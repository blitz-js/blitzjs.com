Blitz uses the `App` component in `app/pages/_app.ts` to initialize pages.
You can modify it to do amazing things like:

- Persisting layout between page changes
- Keeping state when navigating pages
- Custom error handling using `componentDidCatch`
- Inject additional data into pages
- [Add global CSS](./css)

The default `_app.tsx` file looks like this:

```tsx
// app/pages/_app.tsx
export default function App({Component, pageProps}) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />
}
```

The `Component` prop is the active `page`, so whenever you navigate
between routes, `Component` will change to the new `page`. Therefore, any
props you send to `Component` will be received by the `page`.

`pageProps` is an object with the initial props that were preloaded for
your page by one of our data fetching methods like
[`getStaticProps`](./get-static-props) or
[`getServerSideProps`](./get-server-side-props)
