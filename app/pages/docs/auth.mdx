New Blitz apps have authentication and authorization already set up by
default with user sign-up, log-in, and log-out. Your `db/schema.prisma`
file has a `User` and `Session` model and the auth code is in the
`app/auth/` folder.

Blitz has built-in session management that works with email/password auth
and with any third-party providers.

Blitz session management follows the same approach as the state of the art
[SuperTokens library](https://supertokens.io). The CTO of SuperTokens,
[Rishabh Poddar](https://twitter.com/rishpoddar), designed and oversaw our
implementation. We're extremely grateful for Rishabh's help! üôè
