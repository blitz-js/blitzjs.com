[Babel](https://babeljs.io/) is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert
ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in
current and older browsers or environments. Here are the main things Babel
can do for you:

- Transform syntax
- Polyfill features that are missing in your target environment (through a
  third-party polyfill such as
  [core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js))
- Source code transformations (codemods)

## Configuration File {#config}

Blitz adds the `blitz/babel` preset to new apps via the `babel.config.js`
file in the app root. This preset contians everything needed to compile
React applications and server-side code, including source code
transformations that enable
[the import and use of server code](https://blitzjs.com/docs/client-and-server)
directly in your UI components.

If you want to extend the default Babel configs, this is possible. The
`babel.config.js` at the top of your app is considered the source of
truth, and therefore it needs to define what Blitz needs as well, which is
the `blitz/babel` preset.

Here's the default example `blitz.config.js` file:

```jsx
module.exports = {
  presets: ["blitz/babel"],
  plugins: [],
}
```

You can
[take a look at this file](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/blob/canary/packages/babel-preset/src/index.ts)
to learn about the presets included by `blitz/babel`.

To add presets/plugins without configuring them, you can do it this way:

```jsx
module.exports = {
  presets: ["blitz/babel"],
  plugins: ["@babel/plugin-proposal-do-expressions"],
}
```

To add presets/plugins with custom configuration, do it on the
`blitz/babel` preset like so:

```jsx
module.exports = {
  presets: [
    "blitz/babel",
    {
      "preset-env": {},
      "transform-runtime": {},
      "styled-jsx": {},
      "class-properties": {},
    },
  ],
  plugins: [],
}
```

documentation site.

Blitz uses the current Node.js version for server-side compilations.

The modules option on "preset-env" should be kept to false, otherwise
webpack code splitting is turned off.
