You can customize advanced behavior of Blitz with `blitz.config.js`.

`blitz.config.js` is a regular Node.js module, not a JSON file. It gets
used by the Blitz server and build phases, and it's not included in the
browser build.

Take a look at the following `blitz.config.js` example:

```js
module.exports = {
  /* config options here */
}
```

You can also use a function:

```js
module.exports = (phase, { defaultConfig }) => {
  return {
    /* config options here */
  }
}
```

`phase` is the current context in which the configuration is loaded. You
can see the available phases
[here](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/packages/next/next-server/lib/constants.ts#L1-L4).
Phases can be imported from `next/constants`:

```js
const { PHASE_DEVELOPMENT_SERVER } = require("next/constants")

module.exports = (phase, { defaultConfig }) => {
  if (phase === PHASE_DEVELOPMENT_SERVER) {
    return {
      /* development only config options here */
    }
  }

  return {
    /* config options for all phases except development here */
  }
}
```

The commented lines are the place where you can put the configs allowed by
`blitz.config.js`, which are defined
[here](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/packages/next/next-server/server/config.ts#L12-L63).

However, none of the configs are required, and it's not necessary to
understand what each config does, instead, search for the features you
need to enable or modify in this section and they will show you what to
do.

> Avoid using new JavaScript features not available in your target Node.js
> version. `blitz.config.js` will not be parsed by Webpack, Babel or
> TypeScript.

## Webpack Config {#webpack-config}

You can customize the Blitz webpack config. See
[our webpack documentation](./webpack-config) for details

## Build Target {#build-target}

Blitz supports various build targets, each changing the way your
application is built and run. We'll explain each of the targets below.

#### `server` target

Your application will be built and deployed as a monolith. This is the
default target and no action is required on your part to opt-in.

#### `serverless` target

This target will output independent pages that don't require a monolithic
server.

It's only compatible with Serverless deployment platforms (like
[Vercel](https://vercel.com)) — you cannot use the custom server API.

To opt-into this target, set the following configuration in your
`blitz.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  target: "serverless",
}
```

> Deployments to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) will automatically enable
> this target. You should not opt-into it yourself.

## Middleware {#middleware}

HTTP middleware can be added queries and mutations.
[See the middleware documentation](./middleware) for full details.

```js
module.exports = {
  middleware: [
    (req, res, next) => {
      res.blitzCtx.referer = req.headers.referer
      return next()
    },
  ],
```

## Logging {#logging}

By default Blitz logs various things at runtime. You can adjust the
verbosity using the log level setting.

- Default: `info`
- Options: `trace` | `debug` | `info` | `warn` | `error` | `fatal`

```js
module.exports = {
  log: {
    level: "info",
  },
}
```

## CLI {#cli}

When you run `blitz dev`, the console gets cleared. You can disable it by
setting the `cli.clearConsoleOnBlitzDev` to `false`:

```js
module.exports = {
  cli: {
    clearConsoleOnBlitzDev: false,
  },
}
```

## CDN Support with Asset Prefix {#cdn-support-with-asset-prefix}

To set up a [CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network),
you can set up an asset prefix and configure your CDN's origin to resolve
to the domain that Blitz is hosted on.

```js
const isProd = process.env.NODE_ENV === "production"

module.exports = {
  // Use the CDN in production and localhost for development.
  assetPrefix: isProd ? "https://cdn.mydomain.com" : "",
}
```

Blitz will automatically use your prefix in the scripts it loads, but this
has no effect whatsoever on the [public](./static-files) folder; if you
want to serve those assets over a CDN, you'll have to introduce the prefix
yourself. One way of introducing a prefix that works inside your
components and varies by environment is documented
[in this example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-universal-configuration-build-time).

## Custom Page Extensions {#custom-page-extensions}

Aimed at modules like
[@next/mdx](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/next-mdx),
which adds support for pages ending with `.mdx`. You can configure the
extensions looked for in the `pages` directory when resolving pages.

```js
module.exports = {
  pageExtensions: ["mdx", "jsx", "js", "ts", "tsx"],
}
```

## Static Optimization Indicator {#static-optimization-indicator}

When a page qualifies for
[Automatic Static Optimization](./pages#automatic-static-optimization) we
show an indicator to let you know.

This is helpful since automatic static optimization can be very beneficial
and knowing immediately in development if the page qualifies can be
useful.

In some cases this indicator might not be useful, like when working on
electron applications.

```js
module.exports = {
  devIndicators: {
    autoPrerender: false,
  },
}
```

## Configuring onDemandEntries for Development {#configuring-on-demand-entries-for-development}

Blitz exposes some options that give you some control over how the server
will dispose or keep in memory built pages in development.

```js
module.exports = {
  onDemandEntries: {
    // period (in ms) where the server will keep pages in the buffer
    maxInactiveAge: 25 * 1000,
    // number of pages that should be kept simultaneously without being disposed
    pagesBufferLength: 2,
  },
}
```

## Setting a custom build directory {#setting-a-custom-build-directory}

You can specify a name to use for a custom build directory to use instead
of `.next`.

```js
module.exports = {
  distDir: "build",
}
```

Now if you run `blitz build` Blitz will use `build` instead of the default
`.next` folder.

> `distDir` **should not** leave your project directory. For example,
> `../build` is an **invalid** directory.

## Configuring the Build ID {#configuring-the-build-id}

Blitz uses a constant id generated at build time to identify which version
of your application is being served. This can cause problems in
multi-server deployments when `blitz build` is ran on every server. In
order to keep a static build id between builds you can provide your own
build id.

```js
module.exports = {
  generateBuildId: async () => {
    // You can, for example, get the latest git commit hash here
    return "my-build-id"
  },
}
```

## Compression {#compression}

Blitz provides [**gzip**](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6713#section-3)
compression to compress rendered content and static files. Compression
only works with the [`server` target](#server-target). In general you will
want to enable compression on a HTTP proxy like
[nginx](https://www.nginx.com/), to offload load from the `Node.js`
process.

```js
module.exports = {
  compress: false,
}
```

## Disabling ETag Generation {#disabling-e-tag-generation}

By default we generate [etags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_ETag)
for every page by default. You may want to disable etag generation for
HTML pages depending on your cache strategy.

```js
module.exports = {
  generateEtags: false,
}
```

## Disabling x-powered-by {#disabling-x-powered-by}

By default Blitz adds the `x-powered-by` header. To opt-out of it, disable
the `poweredByHeader` config:

```js
module.exports = {
  poweredByHeader: false,
}
```

## Base Path {#base-path}

To deploy a Blitz application under a sub-path of a domain you can use the
`basePath` config option.

`basePath` allows you to set a path prefix for the application. For
example, to use `/docs` instead of `/` (the default), open
`blitz.config.js` and add the `basePath` config:

```js
module.exports = {
  basePath: "/docs",
}
```

Note: this value must be set at build time and can not be changed without
re-building as the value is inlined in the client-side bundles.

### Links {#links}

When linking to other pages using `Link` and `Router` the `basePath` will
be automatically applied.

For example using `/about` will automatically become `/docs/about` when
`basePath` is set to `/docs`.

```js
export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <>
      <Link href={Routes.About()}>
        <a>About Page</a>
      </Link>
    </>
  )
}
```

Output html:

```html
<a href="/docs/about">About Page</a>
```

This makes sure that you don't have to change all links in your
application when changing the `basePath` value.

## Rewrites {#rewrites}

Rewrites allow you to map an incoming request path to a different
destination path.

Rewrites are only available on the Node.js environment and do not affect
client-side routing.

Rewrites are not able to override public files or routes in the pages
directory as these have higher priority than rewrites. For example, if you
have `pages/index.js` you are not able to rewrite `/` to another location
unless you rename the `pages/index.js` file.

To use rewrites you can use the `rewrites` key in `blitz.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  async rewrites() {
    return [
      {
        source: "/about",
        destination: "/",
      },
    ]
  },
}
```

`rewrites` is an async function that expects an array to be returned
holding objects with `source` and `destination` properties:

- `source` is the incoming request path pattern.
- `destination` is the path you want to route to.

### Rewrite parameters {#rewrite-parameters}

When using parameters in a rewrite the parameters will be passed in the
query by default when none of the parameters are used in the
`destination`.

```js
module.exports = {
  async rewrites() {
    return [
      {
        source: "/old-about/:path*",
        destination: "/about", // The :path parameter isn't used here so will be automatically passed in the query
      },
    ]
  },
}
```

If a parameter is used in the destination none of the parameters will be
automatically passed in the query.

```js
module.exports = {
  async rewrites() {
    return [
      {
        source: "/docs/:path*",
        destination: "/:path*", // The :path parameter is used here so will not be automatically passed in the query
      },
    ]
  },
}
```

You can still pass the parameters manually in the query if one is already
used in the destination by specifying the query in the `destination`.

```js
module.exports = {
  async rewrites() {
    return [
      {
        source: "/:first/:second",
        destination: "/:first?second=:second",
        // Since the :first parameter is used in the destination the :second parameter
        // will not automatically be added in the query although we can manually add it
        // as shown above
      },
    ]
  },
}
```

### Path Matching {#path-matching}

Path matches are allowed, for example `/blog/:slug` will match
`/blog/hello-world` (no nested paths):

```js
module.exports = {
  async rewrites() {
    return [
      {
        source: "/blog/:slug",
        destination: "/news/:slug", // Matched parameters can be used in the destination
      },
    ]
  },
}
```

#### Wildcard Path Matching

To match a wildcard path you can use `*` after a parameter, for example
`/blog/:slug*` will match `/blog/a/b/c/d/hello-world`:

```js
module.exports = {
  async rewrites() {
    return [
      {
        source: "/blog/:slug*",
        destination: "/news/:slug*", // Matched parameters can be used in the destination
      },
    ]
  },
}
```

#### Regex Path Matching

To match a regex path you can wrap the regex in parenthesis after a
parameter, for example `/blog/:slug(\\d{1,})` will match `/blog/123` but
not `/blog/abc`:

```js
module.exports = {
  async rewrites() {
    return [
      {
        source: "/old-blog/:post(\\d{1,})",
        destination: "/blog/:post", // Matched parameters can be used in the destination
      },
    ]
  },
}
```

### Rewriting to an external URL {#rewriting-to-an-external-url}

Rewrites allow you to rewrite to an external url. This is especially
useful for incrementally adopting Next.js.

```js
module.exports = {
  async rewrites() {
    return [
      {
        source: "/blog/:slug",
        destination: "https://example.com/blog/:slug", // Matched parameters can be used in the destination
      },
    ]
  },
}
```

#### Incremental adoption of Blitz

You can also make Blitz check the application routes before falling back
to proxying to the previous website.

This way you don't have to change the rewrites configuration when
migrating more pages to Blitz

```js
module.exports = {
  async rewrites() {
    return [
      // we need to define a no-op rewrite to trigger checking
      // all pages/static files before we attempt proxying
      {
        source: "/:path*",
        destination: "/:path*",
      },
      {
        source: "/:path*",
        destination: `https://custom-routes-proxying-endpoint.vercel.app/:path*`,
      },
    ]
  },
}
```

#### Rewrites with basePath support

When leveraging [`basePath` support](#base-path) with rewrites each
`source` and `destination` is automatically prefixed with the `basePath`
unless you add `basePath: false` to the rewrite:

```js
module.exports = {
  basePath: "/docs",

  async rewrites() {
    return [
      {
        source: "/with-basePath", // automatically becomes /docs/with-basePath
        destination: "/another", // automatically becomes /docs/another
      },
      {
        // does not add /docs to /without-basePath since basePath: false is set
        // Note: this can not be used for internal rewrites e.g. `destination: '/another'`
        source: "/without-basePath",
        destination: "https://example.com",
        basePath: false,
      },
    ]
  },
}
```

#### Rewrites with i18n support

When leveraging [`i18n` support](/docs/i18n-routing) with rewrites each
`source` and `destination` is automatically prefixed to handle the
configured `locales` unless you add `locale: false` to the rewrite. If
`locale: false` is used you must prefix the `source` and `destination`
with a locale for it to be matched correctly.

```js
module.exports = {
  i18n: {
    locales: ["en", "fr", "de"],
    defaultLocale: "en",
  },

  async rewrites() {
    return [
      {
        source: "/with-locale", // automatically handles all locales
        destination: "/another", // automatically passes the locale on
      },
      {
        // does not handle locales automatically since locale: false is set
        source: "/nl/with-locale-manual",
        destination: "/nl/another",
        locale: false,
      },
      {
        // this matches '/' since `en` is the defaultLocale
        source: "/en",
        destination: "/en/another",
        locale: false,
      },
    ]
  },
}
```

## Redirects {#redirects}

Redirects allow you to redirect an incoming request path to a different
destination path.

Redirects are only available on the Node.js environment and do not affect
client-side routing.

To use Redirects you can use the `redirects` key in `blitz.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  async redirects() {
    return [
      {
        source: "/about",
        destination: "/",
        permanent: true,
      },
    ]
  },
}
```

`redirects` is an async function that expects an array to be returned
holding objects with `source`, `destination`, and `permanent` properties:

- `source` is the incoming request path pattern.
- `destination` is the path you want to route to.
- `permanent` if the redirect is permanent or not.

### Path Matching {#path-matching-1}

Path matches are allowed, for example `/old-blog/:slug` will match
`/old-blog/hello-world` (no nested paths):

```js
module.exports = {
  async redirects() {
    return [
      {
        source: "/old-blog/:slug",
        destination: "/news/:slug", // Matched parameters can be used in the destination
        permanent: true,
      },
    ]
  },
}
```

#### Wildcard Path Matching

To match a wildcard path you can use `*` after a parameter, for example
`/blog/:slug*` will match `/blog/a/b/c/d/hello-world`:

```js
module.exports = {
  async redirects() {
    return [
      {
        source: "/blog/:slug*",
        destination: "/news/:slug*", // Matched parameters can be used in the destination
        permanent: true,
      },
    ]
  },
}
```

#### Regex Path Matching

To match a regex path you can wrap the regex in parenthesis after a
parameter, for example `/post/:slug(\\d{1,})` will match `/post/123` but
not `/post/abc`:

```js
module.exports = {
  async redirects() {
    return [
      {
        source: "/post/:slug(\\d{1,})",
        destination: "/news/:slug", // Matched parameters can be used in the destination
        permanent: false,
      },
    ]
  },
}
```

#### Redirects with basePath support

When leveraging [`basePath` support](#base-path) with redirects each
`source` and `destination` is automatically prefixed with the `basePath`
unless you add `basePath: false` to the redirect:

```js
module.exports = {
  basePath: "/docs",

  async redirects() {
    return [
      {
        source: "/with-basePath", // automatically becomes /docs/with-basePath
        destination: "/another", // automatically becomes /docs/another
        permanent: false,
      },
      {
        // does not add /docs since basePath: false is set
        source: "/without-basePath",
        destination: "/another",
        basePath: false,
        permanent: false,
      },
    ]
  },
}
```

#### Redirects with i18n support

When leveraging [`i18n` support](/docs/i18n-routing) with redirects each
`source` and `destination` is automatically prefixed to handle the
configured `locales` unless you add `locale: false` to the redirect. If
`locale: false` is used you must prefix the `source` and `destination`
with a locale for it to be matched correctly.

```js
module.exports = {
  i18n: {
    locales: ["en", "fr", "de"],
    defaultLocale: "en",
  },

  async redirects() {
    return [
      {
        source: "/with-locale", // automatically handles all locales
        destination: "/another", // automatically passes the locale on
        permanent: false,
      },
      {
        // does not handle locales automatically since locale: false is set
        source: "/nl/with-locale-manual",
        destination: "/nl/another",
        locale: false,
        permanent: false,
      },
      {
        // this matches '/' since `en` is the defaultLocale
        source: "/en",
        destination: "/en/another",
        locale: false,
        permanent: false,
      },
    ]
  },
}
```

In some rare cases, you might need to assign a custom status code for
older HTTP Clients to properly redirect. In these cases, you can use the
`statusCode` property instead of the `permanent` property, but not both.
Note: to ensure IE11 compatibility a `Refresh` header is automatically
added for the 308 status code.

## Headers {#headers}

Headers allow you to set custom HTTP headers for an incoming request path.

To set custom HTTP headers you can use the `headers` key in
`blitz.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  async headers() {
    return [
      {
        source: "/about",
        headers: [
          {
            key: "x-custom-header",
            value: "my custom header value",
          },
          {
            key: "x-another-custom-header",
            value: "my other custom header value",
          },
        ],
      },
    ]
  },
}
```

`headers` is an async function that expects an array to be returned
holding objects with `source` and `headers` properties:

- `source` is the incoming request path pattern.
- `headers` is an array of header objects with the `key` and `value`
  properties.

### Header Overriding Behavior {#header-overriding-behavior}

If two headers match the same path and set the same header key, the last
header key will override the first. Using the below headers, the path
`/hello` will result in the header `x-hello` being `world` due to the last
header value set being `world`.

```js
module.exports = {
  async headers() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/:path*',
        headers: [
          {
            key: 'x-hello',
            value: 'there',
          },
        ],
      },
      {
        source: '/hello',
        headers: [
          {
            key: 'x-hello',
            value: 'world',
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

### Path Matching {#path-matching-2}

Path matches are allowed, for example `/blog/:slug` will match
`/blog/hello-world` (no nested paths):

```js
module.exports = {
  async headers() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/blog/:slug',
        headers: [
          {
            key: 'x-slug',
            value: ':slug', // Matched parameters can be used in the value
          },
          {
            key: 'x-slug-:slug', // Matched parameters can be used in the key
            value: 'my other custom header value',
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

#### Wildcard Path Matching

To match a wildcard path you can use `*` after a parameter, for example
`/blog/:slug*` will match `/blog/a/b/c/d/hello-world`:

```js
module.exports = {
  async headers() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/blog/:slug*',
        headers: [
          {
            key: 'x-slug',
            value: ':slug*', // Matched parameters can be used in the value
          },
          {
            key: 'x-slug-:slug*', // Matched parameters can be used in the key
            value: 'my other custom header value',
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

#### Regex Path Matching

To match a regex path you can wrap the regex in parenthesis after a
parameter, for example `/blog/:slug(\\d{1,})` will match `/blog/123` but
not `/blog/abc`:

```js
module.exports = {
  async headers() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/blog/:post(\\d{1,})',
        headers: [
          {
            key: 'x-post',
            value: ':post',
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

#### Headers with basePath support

When leveraging [`basePath` support](#base-path) with headers each
`source` is automatically prefixed with the `basePath` unless you add
`basePath: false` to the header:

```js
module.exports = {
  basePath: "/docs",

  async headers() {
    return [
      {
        source: "/with-basePath", // becomes /docs/with-basePath
        headers: [
          {
            key: "x-hello",
            value: "world",
          },
        ],
      },
      {
        source: "/without-basePath", // is not modified since basePath: false is set
        headers: [
          {
            key: "x-hello",
            value: "world",
          },
        ],
        basePath: false,
      },
    ]
  },
}
```

#### Headers with i18n support

When leveraging [`i18n` support](/docs/i18n-routing) with headers each
`source` is automatically prefixed to handle the configured `locales`
unless you add `locale: false` to the header. If `locale: false` is used
you must prefix the `source` with a locale for it to be matched correctly.

```js
module.exports = {
  i18n: {
    locales: ["en", "fr", "de"],
    defaultLocale: "en",
  },

  async headers() {
    return [
      {
        source: "/with-locale", // automatically handles all locales
        headers: [
          {
            key: "x-hello",
            value: "world",
          },
        ],
      },
      {
        // does not handle locales automatically since locale: false is set
        source: "/nl/with-locale-manual",
        locale: false,
        headers: [
          {
            key: "x-hello",
            value: "world",
          },
        ],
      },
      {
        // this matches '/' since `en` is the defaultLocale
        source: "/en",
        locale: false,
        headers: [
          {
            key: "x-hello",
            value: "world",
          },
        ],
      },
    ]
  },
}
```

#### Cache-Control

Cache-Control headers set in blitz.config.js will be overwritten in
production to ensure that static assets can be cached effectively. If you
need to revalidate the cache of a page that has been
[statically generated](/docs/get-static-props#when-should-i-use-getstaticprops),
you can do so by setting `revalidate` in the page's
[`getStaticProps`](/docs/get-static-props) function.

## Export Path Map {#export-path-map}

`exportPathMap` allows you to specify a mapping of request paths to page
destinations, to be used during [export](static-html-export). Paths
defined in `exportPathMap` will also be available when using `blitz dev`.

`exportPathMap` is an async function that receives 2 arguments: the first
one is `defaultPathMap`, which is the default map used by Blitz. The
second argument is an object with:

- `dev` - `true` when `exportPathMap` is being called in development.
  `false` when running `blitz export`. In development `exportPathMap` is
  used to define routes.
- `dir` - Absolute path to the project directory
- `outDir` - Absolute path to the `out/` directory
  ([configurable with `-o`](cli-export)). When `dev` is `true` the value
  of `outDir` will be `null`.
- `distDir` - Absolute path to the `.next/` directory (configurable with
  the [`distDir` config](#setting-a-custom-build-directory))
- `buildId` - The generated build id

The returned object is a map of pages where the `key` is the `pathname`
and the `value` is an object that accepts the following fields:

- `page`: `String` - the page inside the pages directory to render
- `query`: `Object` - the query object passed to `getStaticProps` when
  prerendering. Defaults to `{}`

> The exported `pathname` can also be a filename (for example,
> `/readme.md`), but you may need to set the `Content-Type` header to
> `text/html` when serving its content if it is different than `.html`.

#### Example

Original pages:

- `pages/index.js`
- `pages/about.js`
- `pages/post.js`

`blitz.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  exportPathMap: async function (
    defaultPathMap,
    { dev, dir, outDir, distDir, buildId }
  ) {
    return {
      "/": { page: "/" },
      "/about": { page: "/about" },
      "/p/hello-nextjs": {
        page: "/post",
        query: { title: "hello-nextjs" },
      },
      "/p/learn-nextjs": {
        page: "/post",
        query: { title: "learn-nextjs" },
      },
      "/p/deploy-nextjs": {
        page: "/post",
        query: { title: "deploy-nextjs" },
      },
    }
  },
}
```

## Trailing Slash {#trailing-slash}

By default Blitz will redirect urls with trailing slashes to their
counterpart without a trailing slash. For example `/about/` will redirect
to `/about`. You can configure this behavior to act the opposite way,
where urls without trailing slashes are redirected to their counterparts
with trailing slashes.

Open `blitz.config.js` and add the `trailingSlash` config:

```js
module.exports = {
  trailingSlash: true,
}
```

With this option set, urls like `/about` will redirect to `/about/`.

## Experimental {#experimental}

These features aren't ready for production and could change at any time.

### Isomorphic Resolver Imports {#isomorphic-resolver-imports}

This enables isomorphic code imports from resolver files (for example
exporting a zod schema from a mutation and being able to import that in
client code).

- Default: `false`

```js
module.exports = {
  experimental: {
    isomorphicResolverImports: true,
  },
}
```

### React Mode {#react-mode}

By default Blitz uses
[React Concurrent Mode](https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-intro.html).
You can disable it by changing `experimental.reactMode` to `legacy`.

- Default: `concurrent`
- Options: `concurrent` | `legacy`

```js
module.exports = {
  experimental: {
    reactMode: "legacy",
  },
}
```
