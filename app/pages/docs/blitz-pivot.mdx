**Blitz pivots to a framework agnostic toolkit that preserves the
world-class DX and features we adore but brings it to all Next.js users
and optionally Remix, SvelteKit, Nuxt, etc.**

Your existing Blitz apps will continue to run, and we will fix any
critical bugs that come up. The current blitz codebase will remain. It may
move to a different repo, but it will be preserved and we can continue to
make releases as needed. We'll strive to make the migration to the Blitz
tookit as seamless as possible.

## Pivot Objectives {#objectives}

- Preserve the DX and features we currently have
- Make it easy for millions more of developers to benefit from Blitz
- Decouple Blitz from any specific framework

Blitz toolkit will be meant for building anything with a database, from
side projects to massive enterprise apps. It will both enhance fullstack
DX and provide the missing backend components for JS that Rails and
Laravel enjoy.

## Features {#features}

We believe the core value that Blitz currently provides is:

1. The zero-api data layer,
2. Authentication,
3. Authorization,
4. Conventions,
5. New app templates & code scaffolding.

A new toolkit would start with these as the foundation. We think almost
everything Blitz currently adds would be migrated to the toolkit including
recipes, typesafe Routes manifest, etc. Then we’d start shipping a ton
more awesome things.

For more details check out
[the Blitz Pivot RFC](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/discussions/3075).
It includes an outline of the toolkit, and a list of the features we’d
like to see. It also covers where the pivot is coming from as well as
possible future directions.
