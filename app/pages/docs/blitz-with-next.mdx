title: Add Blitz.js to an Existing Next.js Project
sidebar_label: With Existing Next.js App
---

If you have an existing Next.js project and would like to use some or all
of Blitz Toolkit, this page will provide you with information on setting
it up. A few steps are required, and we'll go through them one by one.

## Adding required dependencies {#adding-dependencies}

```sh
yarn add blitz @blitzjs/next

# or

pnpm add blitz @blitzjs/next

#or

npm i blitz @blitzjs/next
```

## Blitz server setup {#blitz-server-setup}

If you want to use Blitz's server functionalities like auth, middlewares,
rpc, you'd need to create a `blitz-server.ts` file somewhere in your
project, e.g. in `app/blitz-server.ts`. We'll cover how to add plugins
later.

```ts
import { setupBlitzServer } from "@blitzjs/next"

const {
  /* plugins' exports */
} = setupBlitzServer({
  plugins: [
    // plugins will go here
  ],
})
```

## Blitz client setup {#blitz-client-setup}

Now, if you want Blitz's client functionalities, you'll have to create a
`blitz-client.ts` file. It can be next to the `blitz-server.ts` in
`app/blitz-client.ts`.

```ts
import { setupBlitzClient } from "@blitzjs/next"

export const { withBlitz } = setupBlitzClient({
  plugins: [
    // plugins will go here
  ],
})
```

The `withBlitz` function will be needed to wrap your components with
Blitz's client side functionality.

## Use `withBlitz` in your App component {#use-withblitz-in-app-component}

To use Blitz on the client, you also have to use the `withBlitz` function
in your App component.

```ts
import { withBlitz } from "app/blitz-client"

function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />
}

export default withBlitz(App)
```

## Modifying `next.config.js` file {#modifying-next-config-file}

Next.js requires you to manually type out page locations. Blitz comes with
a [Route Manifest](./route-manifest), so you can do:

```tsx
<Link href={Routes.ProductsPage({ productId: 123 })} />
// instead of
<Link href={`/products/${123}`} />
```

To enable it, you have to wrap your config with `withBlitz` in the
`next.config.js` file:

```js
const { withBlitz } = require("@blitzjs/next")

module.exports = withBlitz()
```

## Adding plugins {#adding-plugins}

Now that you're all set with the basic setup, you can add plugins that you
want to use in your app. There are a few places to check out:

1. [`@blitzjs/auth`](./auth-setup) — it covers how to setup auth plugin as
   well as how to use Blitz auth system.
2. [`@blitzjs/rpc`](./rpc-setup) — check it out to learn how to set up
   Blitz's Zero API Layer and to learn more about it.

Finally, you can check out more detailed information about the
[`@blitzjs/next` adapter](./blitz-next) to learn how to use Blitz
functionalities inside of `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`, Next API
Routes, and other places.
