**Alias: `blitz c`**

Starts a Node.js REPL with your [database](./database-overview) and all
your [queries](./query-resolvers) and [mutations](./mutation-resolvers)
preloaded.

This makes it very simple to read or write to your database and run
one-off commands using your queries or mutations. It's also great for
testing and rapid prototype exploration.

#### Examples

```bash
> blitz console

You have entered the Blitz console
Tips: - Exit by typing .exit or pressing Ctrl-D
      - Use your db like this: await db.project.findMany()
      - Use your queries/mutations like this: await getProjects()
✔ Loading your code
