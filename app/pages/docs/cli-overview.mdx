The Blitz CLI is your single access point for interacting with your app,
from database management to code generation. It is opinionated and will
guide you towards best practices, while flexible enough to allow you to
build your project however you'd like.

### Installation {#installation}

You've likely already interacted with the Blitz CLI when setting up your
app. We recommend installing Blitz globally to ensure that you can quickly
run Blitz commands on-demand:

```bash

# npm
npm i -g blitz

# Yarn
yarn global add blitz
```

### Available Commands {#available-commands}

In the following sections you can learn about all of the CLI commands.

Additionally, you can run `blitz help` or `blitz [COMMAND] --help` to get
help directly in your terminal.
