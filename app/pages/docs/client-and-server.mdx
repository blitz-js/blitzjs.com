Blitz is focused on making the communication between server and client
seamless. That means you can import and use server code directly in your
UI components. However, you might be wondering what runs on the server and
what runs on the client. Here's a quick overview.

#### Queries and mutations

Queries and mutations only run on the server â€” at build time, the direct
function import is replaced with an RPC network call. So the query
function code is never included in your client code. It's instead moved to
an API layer.

#### API Routes

API handlers defined in `api/` directory run only on the server. Read more
about [API Routes](link).

#### React Components

Everything inside a page or component file happens both server and client.
However, you can opt-in for a full server-side rendering by exporting an
async function called `getServerSideProps`. The server will call this
function on every request. Read more about
[`getServerSideProps`](./get-server-side-props).

Since React components run both on the server and client, you might face
issues accessing something only available on the client, such as `window`.
Remember to check for `undefined` when using it in React render functions.

Some data doesn't exist on the client's first render (e.g. session), which
causes a quick "flash". You can use
`Page.suppressFirstRenderFlicker = true` to hide the first render.
