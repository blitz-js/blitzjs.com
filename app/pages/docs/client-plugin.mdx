### Overview {#overview}

Plugins can be used to extend the Blitz toolkit with custom functionality
and are defined using the `createClientPlugin` function from the `blitz`
package.

The plugin can then be used to return the following:

- The `events` object contains the event hooks that the plugin could
  listen to.

  - Blitz generates global `Event Listeners` for each `event` which is
    used to trigger the hooks.
  - The plugin can then perform any actions it needs when the event is
    triggered.
  - The code defined by each plugin `event` is executed in `parallel`.

- The `middleware` object contains the middleware hooks that the plugin
  could define.

  - The plugin can then perform any actions it needs when the middleware
    is called.
  - The code defined by each plugin `middleware` is executed in series
    through `pipes`, so the output of one middleware is passed as the
    input to the next middleware.
  - The order in which the middleware is executed is defined by the order
    in which the plugins are defined in the `src/blitz-client` file.

- The `withProvider` function is used to wrap the root component of the
  app through the Blitz wrapper `withBlitz`.

- The `exports` object is used to export any functions or variables that
  the plugin needs to expose to the application through importing from the
  `src/blitz-client` file.

### API Reference {#api-reference}

- `createClientPlugin` -
  `(options: TPluginOptions) => ClientPlugin<TPluginExports>`

  - `events`
    - `onSessionCreated` - `() => Promise<void>`
      - Called when a new session is created.
    - `onRpcError` - `(error: Error) => Promise<void>`
      - Called when an RPC error occurs.
  - `middleware`
    - `beforeHttpRequest` - `(request: RequestInit) => RequestInit`
      - Called before the RPC request is made, allowing the plugin to
        modify the request parameters.
    - `beforeHttpResponse` - `(response: Response) => Response`
      - Called before the RPC response is returned, allowing the plugin to
        modify the response.
  - `withProvider` -
    `(component: ComponentType<TProps>) => {(props: TProps): JSX.Element displayName: string}`

  - `exports` - `TPluginExports extends object`

### Middleware and Events Hooks used by Blitz {#middleware-and-events-used-by-blitz}

- Events
  - `onSessionCreated` is used by `Blitz RPC` to reset the `React Query`
    client when a new session is created by `Blitz Auth`
  - `onRpcError` is used by `Blitz RPC` to handle errors during the
    response phase
- Middleware
  - `beforeHttpRequest` is used by `Blitz Auth` to add required
    authentication headers to the request before its sent by `Blitz RPC`
  - `beforeHttpResponse` is used by `Blitz Auth` to handle auth related
    logic before the response is returned by `Blitz RPC`

### Creating a Client Plugin {#creating-a-blitz-client-plugin}

To create a client plugin, create a new file, for example
`src/custom-plugin/plugin.tsx`, and add the following code:

```tsx
// src/custom-plugin/plugin.tsx
import { createClientPlugin } from "blitz"
import { BlitzPage } from "@blitzjs/next"
import { ComponentProps, ComponentType } from "react"

type CustomPluginOptions = {
  // ... type definitions for options
}

function withCustomPlugin<TProps = any>(
  Page: ComponentType<TProps> | BlitzPage<TProps>
) {
  const CustomPluginRoot = (props: ComponentProps<any>) => {
    // ... custom root component
    return <Page {...props} />
  }
  for (let [key, value] of Object.entries(Page)) {
    CustomPluginRoot[key] = value
  }
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production") {
    CustomPluginRoot.displayName = `CustomPluginInnerRoot`
  }
  return CustomPluginRoot
}

export const BlitzCustomPlugin = createClientPlugin<
  CustomPluginOptions,
  {}
>((options?: CustomPluginOptions) => {
  // ... plugin code
  return {
    events: {
      onSessionCreated: async () => {
        // Called when a new session is created
        // Usually when the user logs in or logs out
      },
      onRpcError: async (error) => {
        // Called when an RPC call fails
      },
    },
    middleware: {
      beforeHttpRequest: (req) => {
        //make changes to the request options before RPC call
        return req
      },
      beforeHttpResponse: (res) => {
        //make changes to the response before returning to the caller
        return res
      },
    },
    exports: () => ({
      // ... plugin exports
    }),
    withProvider: withCustomPlugin,
  }
})
```

### Using a Client Plugin {#using-a-blitz-client-plugin}

To initialise the created client plugin, you could import it in the
`src/blitz-client` and add it to the `plugins` array as shown below:

```ts
// src/blitz-client.ts
import { AuthClientPlugin } from "@blitzjs/auth"
import { setupBlitzClient } from "@blitzjs/next"
import { BlitzRpcPlugin } from "@blitzjs/rpc"
import { BlitzCustomPlugin } from "./custom-plugin/plugin"

export const { withBlitz } = setupBlitzClient({
  plugins: [
    AuthClientPlugin({}),
    BlitzRpcPlugin({}),
    BlitzCustomPlugin({}), // <-- add your plugin here
  ],
})
```

### Example {#example}

The following example shows how to create a plugin that adds a custom
header to your RPC requests

```tsx

export const BlitzCustomPlugin = createClientPlugin<
  CustomPluginOptions,
  {}
>((options?: CustomPluginOptions) => {
  // ... plugin code
  return {
    middleware: {
    beforeHttpRequest: (req) => {
      req.headers = {
        ...req.headers,
        "X-Custom-Header": "Custom Header Value",
      }
      return req
    },
    exports: () => ({
      // ... plugin exports
    }),
  }
})

```
