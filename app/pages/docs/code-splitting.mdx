Blitz automatically optimizes your JavaScript bundles for each page, so
your users will only download the required assets for a given route
(without any extra effort on your part!). This technique is known as
[code splitting](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html).

In the event you need to split or lazy-load assets within a page, Blitz
supports ES2020
[dynamic `import()`](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import) for
JavaScript. With it you can import JavaScript modules (React components,
libraries, etc.) dynamically and work with them. You can think of dynamic
imports as another way to split your code into manageable chunks.

One reason you may want to do this is when a feature on page relies on a
very large library that you don't want the user's browser to have to
download unless they need it (and not all visitors to the page will need
it). You can use dynamic imports to load the library only after the user
has clicked a button or toggled an option somewhere on the page, for
example. This helps keep the initial page load nice and fast for everyone.

Another scenario that may benefit from dynamic imports is using a library
that only works in the browser (perhaps it uses the `window` object
without first checking if it's available). In this case, dynamically
importing the library will prevent it from throwing an error when Blitz
performs server-side rendering.

## Basic usage {#basic-usage}

In the following example, the module `../components/hello` will be
dynamically loaded by the page:

```jsx
import { dynamic } from "blitz"

const DynamicComponent = dynamic(() => import("../components/hello"))

function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <DynamicComponent />
      <p>HOME PAGE is here!</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Home
```

`DynamicComponent` will be the default component returned by
`../components/hello`. It works like a regular React Component, and you
can pass props to it as you normally would.

> **Note**: In `import('path/to/component')`, the path must be explicitly
> written. It can't be a template string nor a variable. Furthermore the
> `import()` has to be inside the `dynamic()` call for Next.js to be able
> to match webpack bundles / module ids to the specific `dynamic()` call
> and preload them before rendering. `dynamic()` can't be used inside of
> React rendering as it needs to be marked in the top level of the module
> for preloading to work, similar to `React.lazy`.

## With named exports {#with-named-exports}

If the dynamic component is not the default export, you can use a named
export too. Consider the module `../components/hello.js` which has a named
export `Hello`:

```jsx
export function Hello() {
  return <p>Hello!</p>
}
```

To dynamically import the `Hello` component, you can return it from the
[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)
returned by
[`import()`](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import#example),
like so:

```jsx
import { dynamic } from "blitz"

const DynamicComponent = dynamic(() =>
  import("../components/hello").then((mod) => mod.Hello)
)

function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <DynamicComponent />
      <p>HOME PAGE is here!</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Home
```

## With custom loading component {#with-custom-loading-component}

An optional `loading` component can be added to render a loading state
while the dynamic component is being loaded. For example:

```jsx
import { dynamic } from "blitz"

const DynamicComponentWithCustomLoading = dynamic(
  () => import("../components/hello"),
  {
    loading: () => <p>...</p>,
  }
)

function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <DynamicComponentWithCustomLoading />
      <p>HOME PAGE is here!</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Home
```

## With no SSR {#with-no-ssr}

You may not always want to include a module on server-side. For example,
when the module includes a library that only works in the browser.

Take a look at the following example:

```jsx
import { dynamic } from "blitz"

const DynamicComponentWithNoSSR = dynamic(
  () => import("../components/hello3"),
  {
    ssr: false,
  }
)

function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <DynamicComponentWithNoSSR />
      <p>HOME PAGE is here!</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Home
```
