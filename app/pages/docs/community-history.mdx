All throughout 2019, Brandon Bayer was wanting something like Ruby on
Rails but for Javascript and React. If you search Twitter history, you'll
see him tweeting about this every so often, saying things like "_someone
please make this so I don't have to._" ðŸ˜‚

Finally in February 2020, Brandon had a phone call with a Ruby on Rails
developer friend. This call sparked him to finally try making Rails for
React. It seemed like good timing with all the new features in Next.js and
Prisma 2 being released in beta.

One week later, Brandon
[officially announced Blitz on February 17, 2020](https://twitter.com/flybayer/status/1229425878481793024).

At the time he only had a couple hundred lines of prototype code. But the
idea resonated with so many people, that many jumped in and helped
architect and build the very first alpha version.

In other words, Brandon essentially built the Blitz community before
building the project.

This turned out to be a great decision.
