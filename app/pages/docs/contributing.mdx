👋 We're so excited you're interested in helping with Blitz! We happy to
help you get started, even if you don't have any previous open-source
experience :)

## First Things First {#first-things-first}

1. New to open source? take a look at
   [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)
2. Familiarize yourself with the
   [Blitz Code of Conduct](./code-of-conduct)
3. Learn [how the community operates](./how-the-community-operates)

## Video Overview of Our Codebase {#video-overview-of-our-codebase}

NOTE: This video is currently outdated as our codebase is going through
some significant refactorings. We'll record a new one soon. But it's
probably still somewhat helpful.
[Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBAkhDrVRiA&feature=youtu.be)
for a walkthrough of the entire Blitz codebase. This is a great way to get
an overview of the various parts and how they fit together!

## What to Work On? {#what-to-work-on}

Issues with the label
[`status/ready-to-work-on`](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/labels/status%2Fready-to-work-on)
are the best place to start.

We also label issues as `good first issue` and `good second issue` when
appropriate.

If you find one that looks interesting and no one else is already working
on it, comment in the issue that you are going to work on it. But only
claim an issue if you can start work on it within a couple days.

Please ask as many questions as you need, either directly in the issue or
in Discord. We're happy to help!

The Blitzjs.com website and documentation repo also has issues with
[`ready to work on | help wanted`](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitzjs.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22ready+to+work+on+%7C+help+wanted%22).

### Things that are ALWAYS welcome {#things-that-are-always-welcome}

- Adding tests
- Improved documentation
- Improved error messages
- Improved logging (i.e. more clear, more beautiful)
- Performance or security improvements
- Educational content like blogs, videos, courses

If there's some other way you'd like to contribute, ask us about it in
Discord!

After you contribute in any way, please add yourself as a contributor via
the
[@all-contributors bot](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/bot/usage)!

## Our Codebase is a Garden {#our-codebase-is-a-garden}

The Blitz codebase is like a community garden. There's a lot of beautiful
plants and vegetables, but it won't take long until you find some weeds!
When you find weeds, please remove them :) Minor refactoring is always
encouraged. If you'd like to do some major refactoring, it's best to first
either open an issue or check with us in Discord. Most likely we'll agree
with you.

## What to Expect After Submitting a PR {#what-to-expect-after-submitting-a-pr}

A Blitz maintainer will review your PR, usually within a couple days.

If your PR changes user facing code, make sure you also made a PR to the
docs repo, otherwise this will block your PR from being merged.

You also need to add tests to cover the changes you made.

Once all the requirements are met and the maintainer is happy with your
code, they will merge it to the canary branch. It will then be included in
the next Blitz release.

Lastly, you will be added the all-contributors list as an official Blitz
contributor. **Congratulations!!**

## Project Management {#project-management}

We use a
[GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/projects/2) to
track all issues and PRs.

## Commit Access {#commit-access}

We give liberal commit access to the Blitz repo to anyone who is a
half-way regular contributor. This allows you to push branches directly to
the Blitz repo without using a fork.

We'll often give someone access if we notice they are regularly
contributing. But you're also welcome to ask for access if you are
regularly helping but haven't been given access yet.

In the main Blitz repo, code reviews by code owners are required to merge
PRs.

But in the docs repo, anyone can merge PRs once someone else has approved
the PR.

## Development Setup {#development-setup}

**1.** Fork [the blitz repo](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz)

**2.** Clone your forked repo

```sh
# replace USERNAME below with your GitHub username
git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/blitz.git
cd blitz
```

**3.** Install dependencies

```sh
yarn
```

**4.** Start the package server. This **must be running** for any package
development or example development

```sh
yarn dev
```

## Running Tests {#running-tests}

### Blitz.js Tests {#blitz-tests}

#### Unit Tests

Most Blitz packages in `packages/` have jest unit tests.

- Run tests in a single package by running `yarn test` inside that package
  folder (like `packages/core/`)
- Run all unit tests from the repo root by running
  `yarn testonly:packages`. (Make sure you have ran `yarn build` or
  `yarn dev` prior to running this)

#### Integration Tests

Blitz integration tests are inside the root `test/` folder.

Make sure you have `chromedriver` installed for your Chrome version. You
can install it with

- `brew install --cask chromedriver` on Mac OS X
- `chocolatey install chromedriver` on Windows
- Or manually download the version that matches your installed chrome
  version (if there's no match, download a version under it, but not
  above) from the
  [chromedriver repo](https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html)
  and add the binary to `<blitz-repo>/node_modules/.bin`

You can run all integration tests by running `yarn test:integration` from
the repo root. Or you can run `yarn testheadles` to run them in headless
mode (so it doesn't open a web browser window).

To run a specific integration test, you can run this:

```sh
yarn testheadless --testPathPattern "integration/queries"
```

where `integration/queries` is the path inside `test/`.

You can manually run the integration app by running `blitz dev` inside the
integration test folder, like `test/integration/queries/`.

#### Example App Tests (to be deprecated)

The example apps have been functioning as our integration tests, but we'll
be moving those tests into the above integation test setup.

To run an example app, first run `yarn build` or `yarn dev` from the repo
root. Then in another window, change to the example app folder like
`examples/auth/` and run `blitz dev`.

To run the example app tests, run `yarn test` from the example app folder.

### Next.js Tests {#nextjs-tests}

All Next.js tests are inside `nextjs/test/`. There are a **lot** of tests,
so probably you will want to run only one at a time.

To run these tests, run the following inside the `nextjs/` folder.

- To run in normal mode (open a browser):
  `yarn testonly --testPathPattern "integration/basic"`
- To run in headless mode:
  `yarn testheadless --testPathPattern "integration/basic"`

The typical workflow will be only run next.js integation tests related to
your change. Then push to CI and see if any other intergration tests fail.
If they do, then locally run the one that fails and fix the issue.

### Testing Development Version of Blitz Inside an App {#testing-development-version-of-blitz}

<Card type="info">

Currently, to test the local dev version of Blitz, you can **only** test
an app inside the `blitz/examples/` folder. In there, the blitz dependency
will automatically use the local dev version. We mainly use the `auth` and
`store` example apps. We use them for development testing and for blitz
integration tests. You must also make sure you are running `yarn dev` in
the `blitz` folder at the same time.

</Card>

For using in apps outside the repo,
[yalc](https://github.com/whitecolor/yalc) should work, but hasn't been
tested yet. If you figure out how to use yalc, please make a PR to this
page explaining how to set it up!

#### Sync your fork

```sh
git remote add upstream git@github.com:blitz-js/blitz.git
./scripts/fetchRemote.sh
git merge upstream/canary
```

#### Link the Blitz CLI (Optional)

The following will link the development CLI as a local binary so you can
use it anywhere for testing.

```sh
yarn link-cli
yarn link blitz
// `yarn unlink blitz`
// `yarn unlink-cli`  will unlink
```

## Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

If you run into issues that should be documented here, please submit a PR!
❤️

#### Windows Subsystem for Linux

`node-pty` error when running `yarn`. Fix by installing `node-pty dependencies`

```sh
sudo apt install -y make python build-essential
```

#### Yarn policies error

This issue is related with yarn > 1.19.1, if you get an error like this in
your console:

```sh
An unexpected error occurred: "expected workspace package to exist for \"@wessberg/rollup-plugin-ts\"
```

Fix it with this command:

```sh
yarn policies set-version 1.19.1
```

#### Git errors

Are you unable to commit? Do you get errors like `yarn: command not found`
or `stdin is not a tty`? That's probably a Husky error! Try checking their
[troubleshoot guide](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/?id=troubleshoot).

#### Preconstruct errors

If you run into symlink and EPERM errors when trying to run Preconstruct
on Windows, you may need to enable
[Windows Developer Mode](https://www.howtogeek.com/292914/what-is-developer-mode-in-windows-10/)
so that Preconstruct can create symlinks.

#### Missing files in Windows

If you have errors about missing files even after you run `yarn build`,
try cloning again your repository with the configuration `core.symlinks`
set to `true` like this: `git clone -c core.symlinks=true <URL>`.
