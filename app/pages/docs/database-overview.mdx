[Prisma's Data Guide](https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/) which covers the
very large majority of everything you might want to know.

By default, Blitz uses Prisma 2 which is a strongly typed database client.

> Prisma 2 is not required for Blitz. You can use anything you want, such
> as Mongo, TypeORM, etc.

##### [Read the Prisma documentation here](https://www.prisma.io/docs/understand-prisma/introduction)

## Add a Database Table {#add-a-database-table}

1. Open `db/schema.prisma` and add your model(s) like as follows:

```prisma
model Project {
  id        Int      @default(autoincrement()) @id
  name      String
  tasks     Task[]
}

model Task {
  id          Int      @default(autoincrement()) @id
  name        String
  project     Project  @relation(fields: [projectId], references: [id])
  projectId   Int
}
```

> If you need,
> [reference the Prisma Schema documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/data-model)

2. Then run `blitz prisma migrate dev` in your terminal to apply the
   changes
3. Now you can import `db` from `db/index.ts` and create a model like
   this:
   - `db.project.create({data: {name: 'Hello'}})`

## Switch to PostgreSQL {#switch-to-postgre-sql}

By default, a Blitz app is created with a local SQLite database. If you
want to use PostgreSQL instead, you need to perform the following steps:

1. [Install and run Postgres locally](./postgres).
1. Open `db/schema.prisma` and change the db provider value from
   `"sqlite"` to `"postgres"` as follows:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgres"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

2. In `.env.local`, change `DATABASE_URL`. For convenience, there is a
   commented-out PostgreSQL `DATABASE_URL` there already. Depending on
   your setup, you may need to modify the URL.
3. Update `.env.test.local` as well to use PostgreSQL in your test runs.
   (It has to point to different database than your `.env.local`)
4. Delete the `db/migrations` folder
5. Run `blitz prisma migrate dev`. This command will create the database
   (if it does not already exist) and tables based on your schema.
