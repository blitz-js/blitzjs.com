## About {#about}

By default, Blitz has a `db/seeds.ts`, where you can add test data to
quickly seed your environment.

This is useful for rebuilding your DB after you messed it up or simply
when it's full of old test data. Good seeds can also make onboarding new
people to the project a lot friendlier (no more, go to this page and
create a new user, then create some tasks for them but make sure to create
at least one project...). Only requirement is that this file makes a
default export.

## Example {#example}

0. Let's say this is your example `db/schema.prisma`:

```prisma
model Project {
  id        Int      @default(autoincrement()) @id
  name      String
  tasks     Task[]
}

model Task {
  id          Int      @default(autoincrement()) @id
  name        String
  project     Project  @relation(fields: [projectId], references: [id])
  projectId   Int
}
```

1. Add `db/seeds.ts`

```ts
import db from "./index"

const seed = async () => {
  const project = await db.project.create({ data: { name: "FooBar" } })

  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    await db.task.create({
      data: {
        name: `Task: ${i}`,
        project: {
          connect: {
            id: project.id,
          },
        },
      },
    })
  }
}

export default seed
```

2. Now simply run `blitz db seed` and you're done. You should be all set
   with fresh new data in your database.
