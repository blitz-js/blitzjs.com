[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a platform that enables developers to
package their apps into standardized containers. These containers can be
deployed to lots of PaaS (like Azure, Google Cloud Platform, AWS, etc.) or
even to your own servers.

## A very basic Dockerfile {#basic}

This is a simple
[Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) aimed only
to be used in production. This Dockerfile will build your app, migrate
your database and start your app on port 3000 (or whatever port you pass
through a build argument).

```dockerfile
FROM node:16

ARG DATABASE_URL
ARG PORT=3000
ENV DATABASE_URL ${DATABASE_URL}

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY package.json yarn.lock ./
COPY db/ ./db/
RUN yarn install --frozen-lockfile
RUN yarn blitz prisma migrate deploy

COPY . .
RUN yarn build

EXPOSE ${PORT}

CMD yarn start -p ${PORT}
```

Along with your `Dockerfile`, remember to create a `.dockerignore`. We
recommend to copy and paste your `.gitignore`.

## Optimized Dockerfiles {#advanced}

Check out
[`LoriKarikari/blitz-docker`](https://github.com/LoriKarikari/blitz-docker#readme).
There are some examples of Dockerfiles following good practices and
optimized for generating a small-sized image. Also, there are Dockerfiles
that can be used both in development and deployment plus some
`docker-compose.yml`.
