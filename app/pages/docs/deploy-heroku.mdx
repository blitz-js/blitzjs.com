This guide assumes the following:

1. That you already have an Heroku account
2. That you’ll be using the Heroku Postgres addon (since Heroku does not
   provide sqlite as a suitable addon)
3. That the application is a completely new application created using the
   [Blitz CLI](/docs/cli-new).
4. That deployments will be made with git and the
   [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli).

**In Heroku:**

1. Create a new application in your desired region
2. Attach the
   [Heroku Postgres addon](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/heroku-postgresql)
   to your application.

**In your terminal:**

1. Login to Heroku using

```
heroku login
```

2. Add your Heroku app as a git remote with the following command
   replacing `<APP_NAME>` with the name you provided or that was given to
   you when creating the Heroku app.

```
heroku git:remote --app <APP_NAME>
```

**In your Blitz application:**

1. Configure the application to use postgres instead of the default sqlite
   by following the
   [“Switch to PostgreSQL” guide](/docs/database-overview#switch-to-postgresql).
2. In your package.json add a `start:production` and a `build` command.
   We'll call the start script in the `Procfile` below. And Heroku will
   run the `build` script for you on deploy.

```diff
"scripts": {
+ "start:production": "blitz start --port $PORT",
+ "build": "blitz build"
}
```

3. Create a `Procfile` file inside the root of your project with the
   following content.

```
release: npx blitz prisma migrate deploy --preview-feature
web: npm run start:production
```

**Deploy using git:**

With these changes committed, to deploy your application, run:

```
git push heroku main
```

Once built you can open your application with the following command in
your terminal

```
heroku open
```

_Note:_ While the application should now be working you will not be able
to use authentication until you provide Heroku with a `SESSION_SECRET_KEY`
envivonment variable. You can do this with the following command replacing
`<MY_SECRET>` with your secret (at least 32 characters long). On macOS and
Linux, you can generate it by running `openssl rand -hex 16` in your
terminal.

```
heroku config:set SESSION_SECRET_KEY=<SESSION_SECRET_KEY>
```
