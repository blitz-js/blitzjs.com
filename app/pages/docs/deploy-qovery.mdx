[Qovery](https://qovery.com) is a fully-managed cloud platform that runs
on your AWS, GCP, Azure and Digital Ocean account where you can host
static sites, backend APIs, databases, cron jobs, and all your other apps
in one place.

1. Visit the [Qovery dashboard](https://console.qovery.com) to create an
   account if you don't already have one.
2. Click on "Create a new project" and give a name to your project.
3. Click on "Create an application" then choose "I have an application"
   and select your GitHub or GitLab repository where your Blitz app is
   located.
4. Select "PostgreSQL" as a service.
5. Select a version and give a name to your database.
6. Click on "Deploy".
7. Click on "master" environment then "blitz" application and "Environment
   Variables" tab.
8. Click "Add", enter `SESSION_SECRET_KEY` as the name, then click on
   "Save all".

**In your Blitz application:**

1. Configure the application to use postgres instead of the default sqlite
   by following the
   [“Switch to PostgreSQL” guide](/docs/database-overview#switch-to-postgresql).
2. In your package.json add a `start:production` and an `build` command.
   We'll call the start script in the `Procfile` below. And Heroku will
   run the `build` script for you on deploy.

```diff
"scripts": {
+ "start:production": "blitz start --port $PORT",
+ "build": "blitz build"
}
```

3. Create a `Procfile` file inside the root of your project with the
   following content.

```
release: npx blitz prisma migrate deploy
web: npm run start:production
```
