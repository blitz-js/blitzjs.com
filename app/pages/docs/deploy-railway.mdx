## If you don't have a Railway account {#signup}

Sign up for an account on [Railway](https://railway.app) - they have a
   free tier that is sufficient for small applications.

## Set up a new project {#setup}

1. Create a new project (via your
   [Dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard) or `âŒ˜ + /` shortcut)

2. If a database is required, select **Provision PostgreSQL** (or
   MongoDB/MySQL/Redis - whichever flavour your app requires). Once the
   database is provisioned, you will see the Project Setup page.

If a database is not required, select **Deploy From Repo**.

There are two ways to set up your project on Railway:

1. [Via the command line interface (CLI)](#cli)
2. [Via Railway's user interface (GUI)](#gui)

### Via CLI {#cli}

1. Install Railway

```bash
npm i -g @railway/cli
# or
yarn global add @railway/cli
```

2. Login to Railway

```
railway login
```

3. Go to your project folder and link to Railway

```
cd /path/to/project
railway link your-project-id
```

The project ID is taken from the **Project Setup** page.

4. Enter your required environment variables

Blitz requires the `SESSION_SECRET_KEY` variable to be set. Go to your
project on the GUI, select the Variables link and enter
`SESSION_SECRET_KEY` as the name of the variables a random 32-key secret
as its value. Click **Add** to add the variable.

Enter other environment variables that you require. The `DATABASE_URL`
variable will be automatically set by Railway if you provision a
PostgreSQL database.

Verify that the variables are set correctly via your linked project:

```
railway variables
```

5. Deploy your project

```
railway up
```

Once the build is successful and deployment is completed, you will receive
the URL for your application that is now accessible via the internet. To
get the URL, go to the **Deployments** section in the project's dashboard
and the URL will be listed under a successful deployment.

You may also view your app logs by running

```
railway logs
```

In order to set Railway to build + deploy automatically when you push to a
branch on your GitHub repository, connect your GitHub repository by
following the [GUI](#gui) steps below from Step 2 onward.

### Via GUI {#gui}

1. Enter your required environment variables

Blitz requires the `SESSION_SECRET_KEY` variable to be set. Go to your
project on the GUI, select the **Variables** link and enter
`SESSION_SECRET_KEY` as the name of the variable and a random 32-key secret
as its value. Click **Add** to add the variable.

Enter other environment variables that you require. The `DATABASE_URL`
variable will be automatically set by Railway if you provision a database.

2. Go to the **Deployments** section. If your project is on GitHub, you
   can click on **Connect GitHub** to deploy and connect directly to your
   repositories on GitHub. Otherwise, you will have to use the [CLI](#cli)
   to deploy your application.

3. Select the repository and the branch to deploy from and click
   **Connect + Deploy**

4. Railway will now build and deploy your app on every push to this branch
   on your selected repository.
