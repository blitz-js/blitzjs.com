You first need to change the defined datasource in `db/schema.prisma` from
SQLite to Postgres

```diff
-datasource sqlite {
- provider = "sqlite"
- url      = "file:./db.sqlite"
-
+datasource postgresql {
+ provider = "postgresql"
+ url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
+}
```

Assuming you already have a [Vercel](https://vercel.com) account:

1. You need a production Postgres database. It's straightforward to set
   this up on
   [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases-postgresql/?refcode=466ad3d3063d).
2. You also need a connection pool. This is also relatively
   straightforward to set up on Digital Ocean.
   1. [Read the Digital Ocean docs on setting up your connection pool](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/databases/postgresql/how-to/manage-connection-pools/#creating-a-connection-pool?refcode=466ad3d3063d)
   2. Ensure you set your "Pool Mode" to be "Transaction"
3. You need your entire database connection string. If you need,
   [read the Prisma docs on this](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/database-connectors/postgresql#connection-details).
   1. Make sure you get the connection string to your connection pool, not
      directly to the DB.
   2. If using pgBouncer (default connection pool on Digital Ocean), you
      must add `&pgbouncer=true` to the end of your connection string for
      Prisma to work correctly.
4. Change your build script in package.json to be
   `NODE_ENV=production blitz build && blitz prisma migrate deploy --preview-feature`
   so that the production DB will be migrated on each deploy
5. Add your DB url as a secret environment variable
   [using the UI](https://vercel.com/blog/environment-variables-ui) or by
   running `vercel env add DATABASE_URL`
6. Add your `SESSION_SECRET_KEY` environment variable (It needs to be 32
   characters long)
7. Run `git push` if using the
   [Git Integration](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/git-integrations) or
   `vercel` if using Vercel CLI

_Tip:_ For optimal response times locate your database and vercel
deployment in the same region.
