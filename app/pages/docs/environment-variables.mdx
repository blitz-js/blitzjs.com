Blitz comes with built-in support for environment variables, which allows
you to do the following:

- [Use `.env*` files to load environment variables](#loading-environment-variables)
- [Expose environment variables to the browser by prefixing with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`](#exposing-environment-variables-to-the-browser)

## Loading Environment Variables {#loading-environment-variables}

Blitz has built-in support for loading environment variables from
`.env.local` into `process.env`.

An example `.env.local`:

```bash
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=myuser
DB_PASS=mypassword
```

This loads `process.env.DB_HOST`, `process.env.DB_USER`, and
`process.env.DB_PASS` into the Node.js environment automatically allowing
you to use them on the server.

> **Note**: Blitz will automatically expand variables inside of your
> `.env*` files. This allows you to reference other secrets, like so:
>
> ```bash
> # .env
> HOSTNAME=localhost
> PORT=8080
> HOST=http://$HOSTNAME:$PORT
> ```
>
> If you are trying to use a variable with a `$` in the actual value, it
> needs to be escaped like so: `\$`.
>
> For example:
>
> ```bash
> # .env
> A=abc
> WRONG=pre$A # becomes "preabc"
> CORRECT=pre\$A # becomes "pre$A"
> ```

## Exposing Environment Variables to the Browser {#exposing-environment-variables-to-the-browser}

By default all environment variables loaded through `.env*` files are only
available in the Node.js environment, meaning they won't be exposed to the
browser.

There are two ways you can expose a variable to the browser.

If you want to expose a variable to the browser, you can prefix it with
`NEXT_PUBLIC_`. For example:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID=abcdefghijk
```

The value will be inlined into JavaScript sent to the browser because of
the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix.

```jsx
// pages/index.js
import setupAnalyticsService from "../lib/my-analytics-service"

// NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID can be used here as it's prefixed by NEXT_PUBLIC_
setupAnalyticsService(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID)

function HomePage() {
  return <h1>Hello World</h1>
}

export default HomePage
```

## Different Values per Environment {#different-values-per-environment}

In general only one `.env.local` file is needed. However, sometimes you
might want to add some defaults for the `development` or `production`
environment.

Blitz allows you to set defaults in `.env` (all environments),
`.env.development` (development environment), `.env.production`
(production environment), and `.env.test` (test environment). These files
with defaults should be checked into git.

Appending `.local` will override the defaults. Examples: `.env.local`,
`.env.test.local`. These files should **not** be checked into git.

## Using custom environments {#custom-environments}

The three default environments are `production`, `development`, and
`test`. However, sometimes, you need an additional environment, e.g.
`staging`, to store env variables for it in a separate file. You can
provide an app environment name by passing `-e` (`--env`) flag or setting
`APP_ENV` directly. For example:

```
APP_ENV=staging blitz build

blitz prisma generate -e=staging

blitz dev --env staging
```

This will load additional env files: `.env.<APP_NAME>` and
`.env.<APP_NAME>.local`.

If you need to load multiple env files, you can pass all the environments
as comma-separated strings. For example:

```bash
blitz dev --env staging,production
# Loaded .env.staging.local
# Loaded .env.staging
# Loaded .env.production.local
# Loaded .env.production
# Loaded .env.local
# Loaded .env
```
