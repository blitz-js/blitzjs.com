Blitz extends the
[default Next.js eslint config](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/eslint#eslint-plugin)

This configuration is found in .eslintrc.js, and by default is

```js
module.exports = {
  extends: ["blitz"],
}
```

## Extending or replacing the default Blitz ESLint config {#extending}

You can extend the base Blitz ESLint config, or replace it completely if
you need.

There are a few things to remember:

1. We highly recommend extending the base config, as removing it could
   introduce hard-to-find issues.
2. It's important to note that any rules that are set to "error" will stop
   the project from building.

In the below example:

- the base config has been extended by a shared ESLint config,
- a new rule has been set that applies to all JavaScript and TypeScript
  files

```js
module.exports = {
  extends: ["blitz", "shared-config"],
  rules: {
    "additional-rule": "warn",
  },
}
```

## Linting During Builds {#during-builds}

When ESLint is detected in your project, Blitz.js fails your **production
build** (`blitz build`) when errors are present.

If you'd like Blitz.js to produce production code even when your
application has ESLint errors, you can disable the built-in linting step
completely.

> Be sure you have configured ESLint to run in a separate part of your
> workflow (for example, in CI or a pre-commit hook). Open
> `blitz.config.js` and enable the `ignoreDuringBuilds` option in the
> `eslint` config:

```js
// blitz.config.js
module.exports = {
  eslint: {
    ignoreDuringBuilds: true,
  },
}
```

## Core Web Vitals {#core-web-vitals}

A stricter `next/core-web-vitals` rule set can also be added in
`.eslintrc`:

```
{
  "extends": ["blitz", "next/core-web-vitals"]
}
```

`next/core-web-vitals` updates some rules from the base config to error on
a number of rules that are warnings by default if they affect
[Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/).
