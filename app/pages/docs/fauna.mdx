title: Using Fauna with Blitz.js
sidebar_label: Fauna

[Fauna](https://dashboard.fauna.com/accounts/register?utm_source=BlitzJS&utm_medium=sponsorship&utm_campaign=BlitzJS_Sponsorship_2020)
is a truly serverless database which is awesome if you are deploying to a
serverless environment like Vercel because you don't have to worry about
connection pools.

You can remove Prisma, which comes in new Blitz apps by default, and
replace it with Fauna.

We have an
[official Blitz + Fauna example app](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/tree/canary/examples/fauna)
that shows how to integrate Fauna with Blitz and with the Blitz
authentication system.
