If a page has dynamic routes
([documentation](/docs/routing/dynamic-routes.md)) and uses
`getStaticProps` it needs to define a list of paths that have to be
rendered to HTML at build time.

If you export an `async` function called `getStaticPaths` from a page that
uses dynamic routes, Blitz will statically pre-render all the paths
specified by `getStaticPaths`.

```jsx
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  return {
    paths: [
      { params: { ... } } // See the "paths" section below
    ],
    fallback: true or false // See the "fallback" section below
  };
}
```

#### The `paths` key (required)

The `paths` key determines which paths will be pre-rendered. For example,
suppose that you have a page that uses dynamic routes named
`app/posts/pages/posts/[id].js`. If you export `getStaticPaths` from this
page and return the following for `paths`:

```js
return {
  paths: [
    { params: { id: '1' } },
    { params: { id: '2' } }
  ],
  fallback: ...
}
```

Then Blitz will statically generate `posts/1` and `posts/2` at build time
using the page component in `app/posts/pages/posts/[id].js`.

Note that the value for each `params` must match the parameters used in
the page name:

- If the page name is `app/posts/pages/posts/[postId]/[commentId]`, then
  `params` should contain `postId` and `commentId`.
- If the page name uses catch-all routes, for example `pages/[...slug]`,
  then `params` should contain `slug` which is an array. For example, if
  this array is `['foo', 'bar']`, then Blitz will statically generate the
  page at `/foo/bar`.
- If the page uses an optional catch-all route, supply `null`, `[]`,
  `undefined` or `false` to render the root-most route. For example, if
  you supply `slug: false` for `pages/[[...slug]]`, Blitz will statically
  generate the page `/`.

#### The `fallback` key (required)

The object returned by `getStaticPaths` must contain a boolean `fallback`
key.

#### `fallback: false`

If `fallback` is `false`, then any paths not returned by `getStaticPaths`
will result in a **404 page**. You can do this if you have a small number
of paths to pre-render - so they are all statically generated during build
time. It’s also useful when the new pages are not added often. If you add
more items to the data source and need to render the new pages, you’d need
to run the build again.

Here’s an example which pre-renders one blog post per page called
`app/posts/pages/posts/[id].js`. The list of blog posts will be fetched
from your database or a CMS and returned by `getStaticPaths` . Then, for
each page, it fetches the data for a single post using `getStaticProps`.

```jsx
// app/posts/pages/posts/[id].js

function Post({post}) {
  // Render post...
}

// This function gets called during pre-rendering
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  // 1. Use a blitz query to get all posts
  // 2. Or call an external API endpoint to get posts
  const posts = /* ... */

  // Get the paths we want to pre-render based on posts
  const paths = posts.map((post) => ({
    params: {id: post.id},
  }))

  // We'll pre-render only these paths at build time.
  // { fallback: false } means other routes should 404.
  return {paths, fallback: false}
}

// This also gets called at build time
export async function getStaticProps({params}) {
  // params contains the post `id`.
  // If the route is like /posts/1, then params.id is 1
  const post = /* get one post */

  // Pass post data to the page via props
  return {props: {post}}
}

export default Post
```

#### `fallback: true`

If `fallback` is `true`, then the behavior of `getStaticProps` changes:

- The paths returned from `getStaticPaths` will be rendered to HTML at
  build time.
- The paths that have not been generated at build time will **not** result
  in a 404 page. Instead, Blitz will serve a “fallback” version of the
  page on the first request to such a path (see
  [“Fallback pages”](#fallback-pages) below for details).
- In the background, Blitz will statically generate the requested path
  HTML and JSON. This includes running `getStaticProps`.
- When that’s done, the browser receives the JSON for the generated path.
  This will be used to automatically render the page with the required
  props. From the user’s perspective, the page will be swapped from the
  fallback page to the full page.
- At the same time, Blitz adds this path to the list of pre-rendered
  pages. Subsequent requests to the same path will serve the generated
  page, exactly like other pages pre-rendered at build time.

#### Fallback pages

In the “fallback” version of a page:

- The page’s props will be empty.
- Using the [router](/docs/router), you can detect if the fallback is
  being rendered, `router.isFallback` will be `true`.

Here’s an example that uses `isFallback`:

```jsx
// app/posts/pages/posts/[id].js
import {useRouter} from "blitz"

function Post({post}) {
  const router = useRouter()

  // If the page is not yet generated, this will be displayed
  // initially until getStaticProps() finishes running
  if (router.isFallback) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>
  }

  // Render post...
}

// This function gets called at build time
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  return {
    // Only `/posts/1` and `/posts/2` are generated at build time
    paths: [{params: {id: "1"}}, {params: {id: "2"}}],
    // Enable statically generating additional pages
    // For example: `/posts/3`
    fallback: true,
  }
}

// This also gets called at build time
export async function getStaticProps({params}) {
  // params contains the post `id`.
  // If the route is like /posts/1, then params.id is 1
  const post = /* ... */

  // Pass post data to the page via props
  return {props: {post}}
}

export default Post
```

#### When is `fallback: true` useful?

`fallback: true` is useful if your app has a very large number of static
pages that depend on data (think: a very large e-commerce site). You want
to pre-render all product pages, but then your builds would take forever.

Instead, you may statically generate a small subset of pages and use
`fallback: true` for the rest. When someone requests a page that’s not
generated yet, the user will see the page with a loading indicator.
Shortly after, `getStaticProps` finishes and the page will be rendered
with the requested data. From now on, everyone who requests the same page
will get the statically pre-rendered page.

This ensures that users always have a fast experience while preserving
fast builds and the benefits of Static Generation.

`fallback: true` will not _update_ generated pages, for that take a look
at
[Incremental Static Regeneration](/docs/get-static-props#incremental-static-regeneration).

#### `fallback: 'blocking'`

If `fallback` is `'blocking'`, new paths not returned by `getStaticPaths`
will wait for the HTML to be generated, identical to SSR (hence why
_blocking_), and then be cached for future requests so it only happens
once per path.

`getStaticProps` will behave as follows:

- The paths returned from `getStaticPaths` will be rendered to HTML at
  build time by `getStaticProps`.
- The paths that have not been generated at build time will **not** result
  in a 404 page. Instead, Blitz will SSR on the first request and return
  the generated HTML.
- When that’s done, the browser receives the HTML for the generated path.
  From the user’s perspective, it will transition from "the browser is
  requesting the page" to "the full page is loaded". There is no flash of
  loading/fallback state.
- At the same time, Blitz adds this path to the list of pre-rendered
  pages. Subsequent requests to the same path will serve the generated
  page, like other pages pre-rendered at build time.

`fallback: 'blocking'` will not _update_ generated pages by default. To
update generated pages, use
[Incremental Static Regeneration](/docs/get-static-props#incremental-static-regeneration)
in conjunction with `fallback: 'blocking'`.

### When should I use `getStaticPaths`? {#when-should-i-use-get-static-paths}

You should use `getStaticPaths` if you’re statically pre-rendering pages
that use dynamic routes.

### TypeScript: Use `GetStaticPaths` {#type-script-use-get-static-paths}

For TypeScript, you can use the `GetStaticPaths` type from `blitz`:

```ts
import { GetStaticPaths } from "blitz"

export const getStaticPaths: GetStaticPaths = async () => {
  // ...
}
```

### Technical details {#technical-details}

#### Use together with `getStaticProps`

When you use `getStaticProps` on a page with dynamic route parameters, you
must use `getStaticPaths`.

You cannot use `getStaticPaths` with `getServerSideProps`.

#### Only runs at build time on server-side

`getStaticPaths` only runs at build time on server-side.

#### Only allowed in a page

`getStaticPaths` can only be exported from a **page**. You can’t export it
from non-page files.

Also, you must use `export async function getStaticPaths() {}` — it will
**not** work if you add `getStaticPaths` as a property of the page
component.

#### Runs on every request in development

In development (`blitz dev`), `getStaticPaths` will be called on every
request.
