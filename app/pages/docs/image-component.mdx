title: Image Component and Image Optimization
sidebar_label: <Image>
---

Blitz has a built-in Image Component and Automatic Image Optimization.

The Blitz Image Component, `Image`, is an extension of the HTML `<img>`
element, evolved for the modern web.

The Automatic Image Optimization allows for resizing, optimizing, and
serving images in modern formats like
[WebP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types)
when the browser supports it. This avoids shipping large images to devices
with a smaller viewport. It also allows Blitz to automatically adopt
future image formats and serve them to browsers that support those
formats.

Automatic Image Optimization works with any image source. Even if the
image is hosted by an external data source, like a CMS, it can still be
optimized.

Instead of optimizing images at build time, Blitz optimizes images
on-demand, as users request them. Unlike static site generators and
static-only solutions, your build times aren't increased, whether shipping
10 images or 10 million images.

Images are lazy loaded by default. That means your page speed isn't
penalized for images outside the viewport. Images load as they are
scrolled into viewport.

Images are always rendered in such a way as to avoid
[Cumulative Layout Shift](https://web.dev/cls/), a
[Core Web Vital](https://web.dev/vitals/) that Google is going to
[use in search ranking](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2020/05/evaluating-page-experience.html).

## Image Component {#image-component}

To add an image to your application, import the `Image` component:

```jsx
import { Image } from "blitz"
import profilePic from "../me.png"

function Home() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>My Homepage</h1>
      <Image src={profilePic} alt="Picture of the author" />
      <p>Welcome to my homepage!</p>
    </>
  )
}

export default Home
```

## Configuration {#configuration}

In addition to using properties available to the `Image` component, you
can optionally configure Image Optimization for more advanced use cases
via `blitz.config.js`.

### Domains {#domains}

To enable Image Optimization for images hosted on an external website, use
an absolute url for the Image `src` and specify which `domains` are
allowed to be optimized. This is needed to ensure that external urls can't
be abused.

```js
module.exports = {
  images: {
    domains: ["example.com"],
  },
}
```

### Loader {#loader}

If you want to use a cloud provider to optimize images instead of using
the Blitz' built-in Image Optimization, you can configure the loader and
path prefix. This allows you to use relative urls for the Image `src` and
automatically generate the correct absolute url for your provider.

```js
module.exports = {
  images: {
    loader: "imgix",
    path: "https://example.com/myaccount/",
  },
}
```

The following Image Optimization cloud providers are supported:

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com): Works automatically when you deploy on
  Vercel, no configuration necessary.
  [Learn more](https://vercel.com/docs/next.js/image-optimization)
- [Imgix](https://www.imgix.com): `loader: 'imgix'`
- [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com): `loader: 'cloudinary'`
- [Akamai](https://www.akamai.com): `loader: 'akamai'`
- Default: Works automatically with `blitz dev`, or a custom server

## Caching {#caching}

The following describes the caching algorithm for the default
[loader](#loader). For all other loaders, please refer to your cloud
provider's documentation.

Images are optimized dynamically upon request and stored in the
`<distDir>/cache/images` directory. The optimized image file will be
served for subsequent requests until the expiration is reached. When a
request is made that matches a cached but expired file, the cached file is
deleted before generating a new optimized image and caching the new file.

The expiration (or rather Max Age) is defined by the upstream server's
`Cache-Control` header.

If `s-maxage` is found in `Cache-Control`, it is used. If no `s-maxage` is
found, then `max-age` is used. If no `max-age` is found, then 60 seconds
is used.

You can configure [`deviceSizes`](#device-sizes) and
[`imageSizes`](#image-sizes) to reduce the total number of possible
generated images.

## Advanced {#advanced}

The following configuration is for advanced use cases and is usually not
necessary. If you choose to configure the properties below, you will
override any changes to the Blitz defaults in future updates.

### Device Sizes {#device-sizes}

In some cases, where you know the expected device widths from the users of
your website, you can specify a list of device width breakpoints using the
`deviceSizes` property. These widths are used when the `Image` component
uses `layout="responsive"` or `layout="fill"` so that the correct image is
served for the device visiting your website.

If no configuration is provided, the default below is used.

```js
module.exports = {
  images: {
    deviceSizes: [640, 750, 828, 1080, 1200, 1920, 2048, 3840],
  },
}
```

### Image Sizes {#image-sizes}

You can specify a list of image widths using the `imageSizes` property.
These widths should be different (usually smaller) than the widths defined
in `deviceSizes` because the arrays will be concatenated. These widths are
used when the `Image` component uses `layout="fixed"` or
`layout="intrinsic"`.

If no configuration is provided, the default below is used.

```js
module.exports = {
  images: {
    imageSizes: [16, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 256, 384],
  },
}
```

## Image API {#image-api}

Image Optimization can be enabled via the `Image` component.

### Usage {#usage}

For an example, consider a project with the following files:

- `pages/index.js`
- `public/me.png`

We can serve an optimized image like so:

```jsx
import { Image } from "blitz"

function Home() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>My Homepage</h1>
      <Image
        src="/me.png"
        alt="Picture of the author"
        width={500}
        height={500}
      />
      <p>Welcome to my homepage!</p>
    </>
  )
}

export default Home
```

### Required Props {#required-props}

The `Image` component requires the following properties.

#### src

Required and must be one of the following:

1. A statically imported image file, as in the example code above, or
2. A path string. This can be either an absolute external URL, or an
   internal path depending on the [loader](#loader).

When using an external URL, you must add it to [`domains`](#domains) in
`blitz.config.js`.

#### width

The width of the image, in pixels. Must be an integer without a unit.

Required, except for statically imported images, or those with
[`layout="fill"`](#layout).

#### height

The height of the image, in pixels. Must be an integer without a unit.

Required, except for statically imported images, or those with
[`layout="fill"`](#layout).

### Optional Props {#optional-props}

The `<Image />` component optionally accepts the following properties.

#### layout

The layout behavior of the image as the viewport changes size. Defaults to
`intrinsic`.

When `fixed`, the image dimensions will not change as the viewport changes
(no responsiveness) similar to the native `img` element.

When `intrinsic`, the image will scale the dimensions down for smaller
viewports but maintain the original dimensions for larger viewports.

When `responsive`, the image will scale the dimensions down for smaller
viewports and scale up for larger viewports.

When `fill`, the image will stretch both width and height to the
dimensions of the parent element, usually paired with
[object-fit](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit).

Try it out:

- [Demo the `fixed` layout](https://image-component.nextjs.gallery/layout-fixed)
- [Demo the `intrinsic` layout](https://image-component.nextjs.gallery/layout-intrinsic)
- [Demo the `responsive` layout](https://image-component.nextjs.gallery/layout-responsive)
- [Demo the `fill` layout](https://image-component.nextjs.gallery/layout-fill)
- [Demo background image](https://image-component.nextjs.gallery/background)

### loader {#loader-1}

A custom function used to resolve URLs. Defaults to
[`images` object in `blitz.config.js`](#loader).

`loader` is a function returning a string, given the following parameters:

- `src`
- `width`
- `quality`

```js
import { Image } from "blitz"

const myLoader = ({ src, width, quality }) => {
  return `https://example.com/${src}?w=${width}&q=${quality || 75}`
}

const MyImage = (props) => {
  return (
    <Image
      loader={myLoader}
      src="me.png"
      alt="Picture of the author"
      width={500}
      height={500}
    />
  )
}
```

#### sizes

A string mapping media queries to device sizes. Defaults to `100vw`.

We recommend setting `sizes` when `layout="responsive"` and your image
will not be the same width as the viewport.

[Learn more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#attr-sizes).

#### quality

The quality of the optimized image, an integer between 1 and 100 where 100
is the best quality. Defaults to 75.

#### priority

When `true`, the image will be considered high priority and
[preload](https://web.dev/preload-responsive-images/).

Should only be used when the image is visible above the fold. Defaults to
false.

#### placeholder

A placeholder to use while the image is loading, possible values are
`blur` or `empty`. Defaults to `empty`. When `placeholder="blur"`, the
`blurDataURL` will be used as the placeholder. If the `src` is an object
from a static import, then `blurDataURL` will automatically be populated.
If the `src` is a string, then you must provide the
[`blurDataURL` property](#blurdataurl).

### Advanced Props {#advanced-props}

In some cases, you may need more advanced usage. The `Image` component
optionally accepts the following advanced properties.

#### objectFit

The image fit when using `layout="fill"`.

[Learn more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit).

#### objectPosition

The image position when using `layout="fill"`.

[Learn more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-position).

#### loading

<Card type="caution">

This property is only meant for advanced usage. Switching an image to load
with `eager` will normally **hurt performance**.

We recommend using the `priority` property instead, which properly loads
the image eagerly for nearly all use cases.

</Card>

The loading behavior of the image. Defaults to `lazy`.

When `lazy`, defer loading the image until it reaches a calculated
distance from the viewport.

When `eager`, load the image immediately.

[Learn more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#attr-loading).

#### blurDataURL

A
[Data URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs)
to be used as a placeholder image before the `src` image successfully
loads. Only takes effect when combined with
[`placeholder="blur"`](#placeholder).

Must be a base64-encoded image. It will be enlarged and blurred, so a very
small image (10px or less) is recommended. Including larger images as
placeholders may harm your application performance.

#### unoptimized

When `true`, the source image will be served as-is instead of changing
quality, size, or format. Defaults to `false`.

### Other Props {#other-props}

Other properties on the `Image` component will be passed to the underlying
`img` element with the exception of the following:

- `style`. Use `className` instead.
- `srcSet`. Use [Device Sizes](#device-sizes) instead.
- `decoding`. It is always `"async"`.
