Want to get better at developing applications using Blitz, but don't know
where to start? You've come to the right spot.

This document is inspired by the
[Frontend Developer Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend). It curates
material on concepts & ideas, tools & libraries and history & trivia
useful to become better at building applications. It is tailored to Blitz,
but most will easily apply elsewhere.

web development, it's totally OK to skip them.

Blitz users!), this is for you:
