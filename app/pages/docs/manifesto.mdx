## Background {#background}

Technology follows a repeating cycle of bundling and unbundling. Created
in 2005, Ruby on Rails became a major bundling force. It made web
application development easier and more accessible than ever before. This
benefited everyone, from those learning programming to seniors building
production systems.

A major unbundling happened in 2013 with the release of React because it
is hyper focused on the rendering layer. As React grew in popularity, so
did the choices for all the other parts, leaving developers with hundreds
of decisions to make when starting a new app. While this has contributed
to JavaScript Fatigue, it's been a powerful driving force for rapid
frontend innovation.

Now, in 2020, is the perfect time for another major bundling. Developers
are yearning for an easier, simpler way to build web applications.
Beginners want a guiding hand for building a robust app. And seniors want
a framework that removes mundane tasks and provides a highly scalable
architecture.

Hence the creation of Blitz.

## What is Blitz For? {#what-is-blitz-for}

Blitz is for building tiny to large fullstack database-backed applications
that have one or more graphical user interfaces like web or mobile apps.

## Foundational Principles {#foundational-principles}

1. Fullstack & Monolithic
2. Convention over Configuration
3. Loose Opinions
4. Easy to Start, Easy to Scale
5. Community over Code

### 1. Fullstack & Monolithic {#1-fullstack-and-monolithic}

A fullstack, monolithic application is simpler than an application where
frontend and backend are developed and deployed separately. Monolithic
doesn't mean it will be slow or hard to scale to large teams. Monolithic
doesn't mean there isn't separation of concerns. Monolithic means you can
reason about your app as a single entity.

### 2. Convention over Configuration {#3-convention-over-configuration}

Starting a new fullstack React app is currently too hard. You have to
spend days on things like configuring eslint, prettier, husky, vitest,
cypress, typescript, deciding on a file structure, setting up a database,
adding authentication and authorization, setting up a router, defining
routing conventions, and setting up your styling library.

Blitz makes as many decisions and does as much work for you as possible.
This makes it lightning fast to start real development. It also greatly
benefits the community. Common project structure and architectural
patterns make it easy to move from Blitz app to Blitz app and immediately
feel at home.

Convention over configuration doesn't mean no configuration. It means
configuration is optional. Blitz will provide all the escape hatches you
need for bespoke customization.

### 3. Loose Opinions {#4-loose-opinions}

Blitz is opinionated. The out-of-the-box experience guides you on a path
perfect for most applications. However, Blitz isn't arrogant. It
understands there are very good reasons for deviating from convention, and
it allows you to do so. For example, Blitz has a conventional file
structure, but, with few exceptions, doesn't _enforce_ it.

And when there's not community consensus, `blitz new` prompts you to
choose.

### 4. Easy to Start, Easy to Scale {#5-easy-to-start-easy-to-scale}

A framework that's only easy for one end of an application lifecycle is
not a good framework. Both starting and scaling must be easy.

Easy to start includes being easy for beginners and being easy to migrate
existing Next.js apps to Blitz.

Scaling is important in all forms: lines of code, number of people working
in the codebase, and code execution.

### 5. Community over Code {#6-community-over-code}

The Blitz community is the most important aspect of the framework, by far.
We have a comprehensive [Code of Conduct](./code-of-conduct).

We are all in this together, from the youngest to the oldest. We are all
more similar than we are different. We can and should solve problems
together. We should learn from other communities, not compete against
them.
