## Migrating from Next.js {#migrating-from-next}

Blitz is built on top of Next.js, so naturally follows Next's priciples
and patterns. The difference between Next and Blitz is that Blitz adds all
the missing features and functionality that turns Next into a true
fullstack framework. That also means that you can migrate to Blitz in a
few steps.

### 1. Install Dependencies {#install-deps}

You need to replace `next` dependency with `blitz`.

```sh
yarn remove next ## npm uninstall next
yarn add blitz ## npm install blitz
```

We recommend using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (but it's
not a requirement!). If you're not doing it already, you can add
TypeScript with following commands:

```sh
yarn add typescript ## npm install typescript
yarn tsc init ## npx tsc init
```

The second command will create a `tsconfig.json` file with TypeScript
configuration. Here's an example `tsconfig.json` that you can use:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es5",
    "lib": ["dom", "dom.iterable", "esnext"],
    "baseUrl": "./",
    "allowJs": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "strict": false,
    "strictNullChecks": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "module": "esnext",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "jsx": "preserve",
    "incremental": true,
    "tsBuildInfoFile": ".tsbuildinfo"
  },
  "exclude": ["node_modules"],
  "include": ["blitz-env.d.ts", "next-env.d.ts" "**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx"]
}
```

`"allowJs": true` option will let you keep your JavaScript files so that
you don't have to migrate your application at once.

### 2. Update Scripts in `package.json` {#update-scripts}

Instead of using `next` to run a command, you can use `blitz`. There are a
few other commands that you can find useful — read about it
[here](/docs/cli-overview).

```diff
"scripts": {
  "dev": "blitz dev",
  "build": "blitz build",
  "start": "blitz start"
}
```

### 3. Rename the Configuration File {#rename-config-file}

As the third step, you need to rename `next.config.js` to
`blitz.config.ts` (or if you aren't using TypeScript, to
`blitz.config.js`). To learn more about the configuration, check out the
[docs](/docs/blitz-config).

## Optional Next Steps {#next-steps}

If you want to start using Blitz's [queries](/docs/query-resolvers) and
[mutations](/docs/mutation-resolvers), we recommend creating an `app`
folder and writing your application logic there. You can take a look at
[the default file structure of newly generated Blitz apps](/docs/file-structure).
Below, we'll cover how to setup a database, and Blitz's auth.

#### Add a Database {#add-database}

By default, Blitz uses Prisma which is a strongly typed database client.
If you are new to databases, check out
[Prisma's Data Guide](https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/) which covers the
very large majority of everything you might want to know.

As the first step, you need to add the required dependecies:

```sh
yarn add prisma @prisma/client ## npm install prisma @prisma/client
```

Once this is done, you can initialize Prisma:

```sh
blitz prisma init
```

You can optionally pass `--datasource-provider=sqlite` for a quick SQLite
database to use in your development enviroment. The default driver is
Postgres.

The `init` command will create a new folder, `prisma`, with a
`schema.prisma` file where you can define your database models.

For Blitz to work properly, you'll need to rename the `prisma` folder to
`db`, and add the following to your `package.json` file:

```json
"prisma": {
  "schema": "db/schema.prisma"
},
```

Then, you have to create a `index.ts` (or `index.js`) file in the `db`
folder. Inside we'll use `enhancePrisma` function from Blitz to wrap the
Prisma's client:

```ts
// db/index.ts

import { enhancePrisma } from "blitz"
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client"

const EnhancedPrisma = enhancePrisma(PrismaClient)

export * from "@prisma/client"
export default new EnhancedPrisma()
```

Check out our [Database Overview docs](/docs/database-overview) to learn
more about the database setup, Prisma, and some useful utilities.

#### Setup Blitz's Auth {#setup-blitz-auth}

In order to use Blitz's built-in auth, you need to create required
database models. Add the following code to your `db/schema.prisma` file:

```prisma
model User {
  id             Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  createdAt      DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt      DateTime @updatedAt
  name           String?
  email          String   @unique
  hashedPassword String?
  role           String   @default("USER")

  tokens   Token[]
  sessions Session[]
}

model Session {
  id                 Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  createdAt          DateTime  @default(now())
  updatedAt          DateTime  @updatedAt
  expiresAt          DateTime?
  handle             String    @unique
  hashedSessionToken String?
  antiCSRFToken      String?
  publicData         String?
  privateData        String?

  user   User? @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  userId Int?
}

model Token {
  id          Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt
  hashedToken String
  type        String
  expiresAt   DateTime
  sentTo      String

  user   User @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  userId Int

  @@unique([hashedToken, type])
}
```

Then run `blitz prisma migrate dev` in your terminal to apply the changes
to your database and update Prisma client.

You also need to update your `blitz.config.ts` file and add
`sessionMiddleware` setup:

```ts
// blitz.config.ts
import { BlitzConfig, sessionMiddleware } from "blitz"

const config: BlitzConfig = {
  middleware: [
    sessionMiddleware({
      cookiePrefix: "your-app-name",
    }),
  ],
}

module.exports = config
```

You can take a look at
[our examples](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/tree/canary/examples/auth/app/auth/mutations)
to see how to implement login, logout, sign up, and more, with Blitz's
mutations and sessions.

Follow [this documentation](/docs/authorization#is-authorized-adapters) to
setup authorization.

## Incrementally Adopting Blitz {#migrating-incrementally}

You can adopt Blitz incrementally by starting small and adding more pages
over time. This way you can prevent derailing feature work by avoiding a
complete rewrite.

### Using Subpath {#subpath}

The first strategy is to configure your server or proxy such that
everything under a specific subpath points to a Blitz app. For example,
your existing website might be at `example.com`, and you might configure
your proxy such that `example.com/store` serves a Blitz e-commerce store.

Using [`basePath`](/docs/blitz-config#base-path), you can configure your Blitz
application's assets and links to automatically work with your new subpath
`/store`. Since each page in Blitz is its own
[standalone route](/docs/routing), pages like `pages/products/index.tsx` will
route to `example.com/store/products` in your application.

```ts
// blitz.config.ts
import { BlitzConfig } from "blitz"

const config: BlitzConfig = {
  basePath: "/store",
}

module.exports = config
```

To learn more about `basePath`, take a look at our
[documentation](/docs/blitz-config#base-path).

### Using Rewrites {#rewrites}

The second strategy is to create a new Blitz app that points to the root
URL of your domain. Then, you can use [`rewrites`](/docs/rewrites) inside
`blitz.config.ts` to have some subpaths to be proxied to your existing
app.

For example, let's say you created a Blitz app to be served from
`example.com` with the following `blitz.config.ts`. Now, requests for the
pages you’ve added to this Blitz app (e.g. `/about` if you’ve added
`pages/about.tsx`) will be handled by Blitz, and requests for any other
route (e.g. `/dashboard`) will be proxied to `proxy.example.com`.

```ts
// blitz.config.ts
import { BlitzConfig } from "blitz"

const config: BlitzConfig = {
  async rewrites() {
    return {
      // After checking all Blitz pages (including dynamic routes)
      // and static files we proxy any other requests
      fallback: [
        {
          source: "/:path*",
          destination: `https://proxy.example.com/:path*`,
        },
      ],
    }
  },
}

module.exports = config
```

To learn more about rewrites, take a look at our
[documentation](/docs/rewrites).
