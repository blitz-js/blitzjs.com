Multitenancy is a software architecture where a single app can server
multiple different users or organizations whose data is kept private from
the other users of the system. One way to do this is have a totally
separate database for each user, but that has a high operations overhead.
The most common way is to store all user data in a single database and use
foreign keys to keep data private.

This guide shows you a good way to implement a multitenant Blitz app.

## Data Model {#data-model}

We recommend implementing the data model
[as described by Andrew Culver of Bullet Train](https://blog.bullettrain.co/teams-should-be-an-mvp-feature/).

- The `Organization` is the "God" model which owns everything for an
  account
- An `Organization` **has many** `User`s **through** `Membership`
- Every other model in the system has an `organizationId` to indicate who
  owns it.
- A `User` can have access to multiple `Organization`s
- When assigning an entity to a user, like a task, assign the task to the
  user's `Membership` instead of directly to the user. See the Bullet
  Train blog post linked above for more explanation on this.

The prisma schema looks like this:

```prisma
model Organization {
  id         Int @id @default(autoincrement())
  name       String
  role       GlobalRole

  membership Membership[]
}

// The owners of the SaaS (you) can have a SUPERADMIN role to access all data
enum GlobalRole {
  SUPERADMIN
  CUSTOMER
}

model Membership {
  id             Int @id @default(autoincrement())
  role           MembershipRole

  organization   Organization @relation(fields: [organizationId], references: [id])
  organizationId Int

  user           User? @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  userId         Int?

  // When the user joins, we will clear out the name and email and set the user.
  invitedName  String?
  invitedEmail String?

  @@unique([organizationId, invitedEmail])
}

enum MembershipRole {
  OWNER
  ADMIN
  USER
}

model User {
  id             Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  createdAt      DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt      DateTime @updatedAt
  name           String?
  email          String   @unique

  memberships Membership[]
}
```

Then you will need to update your `signup` mutation to also create an
organization and membership at the same time as you create the user. Like
this:

```ts
const user = await db.user.create({
  data: {
    // ...
    memberships: {
      create: {
        role: "OWNER",
        organization: {
          create: {
            name: organizationName,
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
})
```

## User Sessions {#sessions}

The above data model allows a single user to be in multiple organizations.
So how can we track which organization a user is currently accessing or
modifying?

The best way is to only let a user access one organization at a time. And
then provide a menu in the UI that let's them switch which organization
they are accessing.

To do that, first add an `orgId` field to the
[session `PublicData`](./session-management#change-session-public-data-of-current-user).

Update `types.ts` like this:

```diff
+import { GlobalRole, MembershipRole, Organization } from "db"

declare module "blitz" {
  export interface Ctx extends DefaultCtx {
    session: SessionContext
  }
  export interface Session {
    isAuthorized: SimpleRolesIsAuthorized<Role>
    PublicData: {
       userId: User["id"]
+      roles: Array<MembershipRole & GlobalRole>
+      orgId: Organization["id"]
    }
  }
}
```

and then update all places where you call `ctx.session.$create()`. You
will need to add `orgId` and update `roles`.

It will look something like this:

```ts
await session.$create({
  userId: user.id,
  roles: [user.role, user.memberships[0].role],
  orgId: user.memberships[0].organizationId,
})
```

Then you can use `ctx.session.orgId` in queries and mutations to filter
your queries based on the current organization.

## Queries {#queries}

You must filter all your queries by `organizationId` to ensure one user
cannot see another user's private data.

```ts
import db from "db"

// If you accept only the `id` as input
const project = await db.project.findFirst({
  where: {
    id: input.id,
    organizationId: ctx.session.orgId,
  },
})

// If you accept `where` as input
const projects = await db.project.findMany({
  where: {
    ...input.where,
    organizationId: ctx.session.orgId,
  },
})
```

## Mutations {#mutations}

When creating new entities, make sure you attach them to the current
organization. Here's an example of how to do that:

```ts
import { resolver } from "blitz"
import db from "db"
import * as z from "zod"

const CreateProject = z
  .object({
    name: z.string(),
  })
  .nonstrict()

export default resolver.pipe(
  resolver.zod(CreateProject),
  resolver.authorize(),
  async (input, ctx) => {
    const project = await db.project.create({
      data: {
        ...input,
        organizationId: ctx.session.orgId,
      },
    })

    return project
  }
)
```

You must also filter update and delete mutations by `organizationId` to
ensure another user's data can't be changed.

Here's an example where a mutation accepts `id` that could be the id of an
entity belonging to a different organization. You could first make a
`db.project.findFirst()` query for that id and then manually verify that
`organizationId` is correct. But the easier way shown here is by adding
`organizationId` to the `db.update` `where` input. This update call will
fail if the organizationId doesn't match.

```ts
import { resolver } from "blitz"
import db from "db"
import * as z from "zod"

const UpdateProject = z
  .object({
    id: z.number(),
    name: z.string(),
  })
  .nonstrict()

export default resolver.pipe(
  resolver.zod(UpdateProject),
  resolver.authorize(),
  async ({ id, ...data }, ctx) => {
    const project = await db.project.update({
      where: {
        id,
        // Filter by organizationId
        organizationId: ctx.session.orgId,
      },
      data,
    })

    return project
  }
)
```

## Advanced Authorization {#authorization}

You can do more advanced things like calling `ctx.session.$authorize()`
inside an if/else

```ts
import { resolver } from "blitz"
import db, { GlobalRole, MembershipRole } from "db"
import * as z from "zod"

const UpdateProject = z
  .object({
    id: z.number(),
    organizationId: z.number(),
    name: z.string(),
  })
  .nonstrict()

export default resolver.pipe(
  resolver.zod(UpdateProject),
  // Ensure all users are logged in
  resolver.authorize(),
  async ({ id, organizationId, ...data }, ctx) => {
    // if organizationId doesn't match current organization
    if (organizationId !== ctx.session.orgId) {
      // Require SUPERADMIN role
      ctx.session.$authorize(GlobalRole.SUPERADMIN)
    } else if (!ctx.session.accessibleProjects.includes(id)) {
      // If user doesn't have specific access to this project,
      // require them to be a project manager
      ctx.session.$authorize(MembershipRole.PROJECT_MANAGER)
    }

    const project = await db.project.update({
      where: {
        id,
        organizationId,
      },
      data,
    })

    return project
  }
)
```

#### Utilities

Here's some advanced utilities that allow you to do authorization in a way
that allows SUPERADMINs to access all organizations but only permits
regular users to access the organization they are currently logged in to.

```ts
// app/orders/queries/getOrder.ts
import { NotFoundError, resolver } from "blitz"
import db from "db"
import * as z from "zod"
import {
  enforceAdminOrProctorIfNotCurrentOrganization,
  setDefaultOrganizationId,
} from "app/core/utils"

const GetOrder = z.object({
  id: z.number(),
  organizationId: z.number().optional(),
})

export default resolver.pipe(
  resolver.zod(GetOrder),
  // Ensure user is logged in
  resolver.authorize(), //highlight-line
  // Set input.organizationId to the current organization if one is not set
  // This allows SUPERADMINs to pass in a specific organizationId
  setDefaultOrganizationId, //highlight-line
  // But now we need to enforce input.organizationId matches
  // session.orgId unless user is a SUPERADMIN
  enforceSuperAdminIfNotCurrentOrganization, //highlight-line
  async ({ id, organizationId }) => {
    const order = await db.getOrder({
      where: {
        id,
        // Now we can safely use organizationId to filter queries
        organizationId,
      },
    })
    if (!order) throw new NotFoundError()
    return order
  }
)
```

```ts
// app/core/utils.ts
import { Ctx } from "blitz"
import { Prisma, GloblRole } from "db"

export default function assert(
  condition: any,
  message: string
): asserts condition {
  if (!condition) throw new Error(message)
}

export const setDefaultOrganizationId = <T extends Record<any, any>>(
  input: T,
  { session }: Ctx
): T & { organizationId: Prisma.IntNullableFilter | number } => {
  assert(
    session.orgId,
    "Missing session.orgId in setDefaultOrganizationId"
  )
  if (input.organizationId) {
    // Pass through the input
    return input as T & { organizationId: number }
  } else if (session.roles?.includes(GloblRole.SUPERADMIN)) {
    // Allow viewing any organization
    return { ...input, organizationId: { not: 0 } }
  } else {
    // Set organizationId to session.orgId
    return { ...input, organizationId: session.orgId }
  }
}

export const enforceSuperAdminIfNotCurrentOrganization = <
  T extends Record<any, any>
>(
  input: T,
  ctx: Ctx
): T => {
  assert(ctx.session.orgId, "missing session.orgId")
  assert(input.organizationId, "missing input.organizationId")

  if (input.organizationId !== ctx.session.orgId) {
    ctx.session.$authorize(GloblRole.SUPERADMIN)
  }
  return input
}
```
