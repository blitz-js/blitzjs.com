Blitz mutations are plain, asynchronous JavaScript functions that always
run on the server.

**1. Mutations must be inside a `mutations` folder. All of the following
are valid:**

- `app/mutations/createProject.ts`
- `app/projects/mutations/createProject.ts`
- `app/admin/projects/mutations/createProject.ts`

**2. Mutations must export a function as the default export**

You can write any normal Node.js code here, including database access and
fetching from third-party APIs.

#### Arguments

- `input: any`
  - The first argument is anything you need for your mutation. There are
    no special requirements.
- `ctx: Ctx`
  - This context object is automatically provided by Blitz at run time.
    This is used by [HTTP Middleware](./middleware) to provide data or
    functions to your mutation. For example, authentication middleware can
    provide `ctx.session` with all the data about the current user
    session.

#### Example Mutation

```ts
// app/products/mutations/createProduct.tsx
import { Ctx } from "blitz"
import db from "db"
import * as z from "zod"

const CreateProject = z
  .object({
    name: z.string(),
  })
  .nonstrict()

export default async function createProject(
  input: z.infer<typeof CreateProject>,
  ctx: Ctx
) {
  // Validate input - very important for security
  const data = CreateProject.parse(input)

  // Require user to be logged in
  ctx.session.$authorize()

  const project = await db.project.create({ data })

  // Can do any processing, fetching from other APIs, etc

  return project
}
```

_We automatically alias the root of your project, so `import db from 'db'`
is importing `<project_root>/db/index.ts`_

Next, [read these docs](./mutation-usage) to see how to use these
mutations in your components.
