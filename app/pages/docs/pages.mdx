In Blitz, a **page** is a
[React Component](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)
exported from a `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, or `.tsx` file in a `pages`
directory. Each page is associated with a route based on its file path.

All of the following are valid pages:

- `app/pages/about.tsx`
- `app/projects/pages/projects/index.tsx`
- `app/tasks/pages/projects/[projectId]/tasks/[taskId].tsx`

**Example**: If you create `app/pages/about.js` that exports a React
component like below, it will be accessible at `/about`.

```jsx
function About() {
  return <div>About</div>
}

export default About
```

### Pages with Dynamic Routes {#pages-with-dynamic-routes}

Blitz supports pages with dynamic routes. For example, if you create a
file called `app/pages/posts/[id].js`, then it will be accessible at
`posts/1`, `posts/2`, etc.

### Automatic Static Optimization {#automatic-static-optimization}

By default, Blitz pre-renders the static HTML for every page unless you
explicitly opt-in to server-side rendering.

For pages with dynamic data, the page's loading fallback state will be
rendered unless you [prefetch](./query-usage#prefetching) the data to
populate the cache.

In some cases, the static optimization can cause an undesirable UX where
the first render shows one thing but the second render shows another. For
example this happens when using `useSession()`.

Next, we'll introduce some ways to improve the way Blitz pre-renders your
pages.

### First Render UX {#first-render-ux}

To provide a better User Experience (UX), Blitz tries to automatically
pre-render the HTML for your pages, but if your page contains dynamic data
fetched with [useQuery](./use-query) hooks, Blitz will fallback to the
page's loading state and you will not see much benefit from the automatic
pre-rendering, because the application will need to immediately make
another request to fetch the data it needs to satisfy the query.

In this case you can set `Page.suppressFirstRenderFlicker = true`, and
Blitz will hide the first render's content. This will result in a tiny
delay of first paint but will greatly improve the perceived UX.

```tsx
const Page: BlitzPage = () => {
  return <div>{/* ... */}</div>
}

// highlight-start
Page.suppressFirstRenderFlicker = true
// highlight-end

export default Page
```
In case you have set `Page.authenticate = true` or `Page.redirectAuthenticatedTo = true`,
Blitz will hide the first render's content. For these cases, you can simply ignore setting
`Page.suppressFirstRenderFlicker = true`.
 

You can also consider prefetching all of the necessary queries that your
page needs to complete its first render. You can use either the
`getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` page functions, depending on what
you need.

If you create an instance of QueryClient and populate it with query data,
then you can pass it as `dehydratedState` to your page props. Blitz will
automatically use the state to build the query cache later when the page
tries to render.

```tsx
import {
  useQuery, 
  getQueryKey, 
  invokeWithMiddleware, 
  dehydrate, 
  QueryClient, 
  BlitzPage, 
  GetServerSidePropsContext
} from 'blitz'
const Page: BlitzPage = () => {
  // highlight-start
  const [organization] = useQuery(getCurrentOrganization, null)
  // highlight-end

  return <div>You have selected: {organization.name}</div>
}

export async function getServerSideProps(ctx: GetServerSidePropsContext) {
  const queryClient = new QueryClient()

  // highlight-start
  const queryKey = getQueryKey(getCurrentOrganization, null)
  await queryClient.prefetchQuery(queryKey, () =>
    invokeWithMiddleware(getCurrentOrganization, null, ctx),
  )
  // highlight-end

  return {
    props: {
      dehydratedState: dehydrate(queryClient),
    },
  }
}
```

In this way, the pre-rendered version of your page HTML will not have to
make a request as soon as it loads to fetch any data and will avoid any
screen flickering. This is very useful for Search Engine Optimization and
the Link Previews used by Social Media sites like Facebook and Twitter.

You can also use prefetching to pre-populate queries that a user might
need shortly after the page loads--such a common searches or filter
criteria--by setting a [staleTime](./use-query#options) on the query being
prefetched.

### Static Page Generation for Unauthenticated Pages {#static-page-generation-for-unauthenticated-pages}

For pages accessible by anyone without authentication, we recommend using
`getStaticProps` so the page, along with it's data, is 100% statically
generated during pre-rendering (like Gatsby). Then the entire static page
can be cached on a CDN. This is perfect for public pages like blog posts.

There are two methods for use with static generation, and you'll often use
both together.

1. `getStaticProps` - To load the **data** for your page. See the
   [`getStaticProps` documentation](./get-static-props) for more details.
2. `getStaticPaths` - To load the possible **paths** for your page. See
   the [`getStaticPaths` documentation](./get-static-paths) for more
   details.

### Server-side Rendering {#server-side-rendering}

> Also referred to as "SSR" or "Dynamic Rendering".

If a page uses **Server-side Rendering**, the page HTML is generated on
**each request**.

To use Server-side Rendering for a page, you need to `export` an `async`
function called `getServerSideProps`. This function will be called by the
server on every request.

See the `getServerSideProps` [documentation](./get-server-side-props) for
more details.
