In Blitz, a **page** is a
[React Component](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)
exported from a `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, or `.tsx` file in a `pages`
directory. Each page is associated with a route based on its file path.

All of the following are valid pages:

- `app/pages/about.tsx`
- `app/projects/pages/projects/index.tsx`
- `app/tasks/pages/projects/[projectId]/tasks/[taskId].tsx`

**Example**: If you create `app/pages/about.js` that exports a React
component like below, it will be accessible at `/about`.

```jsx
function About() {
  return <div>About</div>
}

export default About
```

### Pages with Dynamic Routes {#pages-with-dynamic-routes}

Blitz supports pages with dynamic routes. For example, if you create a
file called `app/pages/posts/[id].js`, then it will be accessible at
`posts/1`, `posts/2`, etc.

> To learn more about routing, check the
> [Routing documentation](./routing).

### Automatic Static Optimization {#automatic-static-optimization}

By default, Blitz pre-renders the static HTML for every page unless you
explicitly opt-in to server-side rendering.

For pages with dynamic data, the page's loading state will be
pre-rendered.

#### First Render UX

In some cases, the static optimization can cause an undesirable UX where
the first render shows one thing but the second render shows another. For
example this happens when using `useSession()`.

In this case you can set `Page.suppressFirstRenderFlicker = true`, and
Blitz will hide the first render's content. This will result in a tiny
delay of first paint but will greatly improve the perceived UX.

```tsx
const Page: BlitzPage = () => {
  return <div>{/* ... */}</div>
}

// highlight-start
Page.suppressFirstRenderFlicker = true
// highlight-end

export default Page
```

### Static Page Generation for Unauthenticated Pages {#static-page-generation-for-unauthenticated-pages}

For pages accessible by anyone without authentication, we recommend using
`getStaticProps` so the page, along with it's data, is 100% statically
generated during pre-rendering (like Gatsby). Then the entire static page
can be cached on a CDN. This is perfect for public pages like blog posts.

There are two methods for use with static generation, and you'll often use
both together.

1. `getStaticProps` - To load the **data** for your page. See the
   [`getStaticProps` documentation](./get-static-props) for more details.
2. `getStaticPaths` - To load the possible **paths** for your page. See
   the [`getStaticPaths` documentation](./get-static-paths) for more
   details.

### Server-side Rendering {#server-side-rendering}

> Also referred to as "SSR" or "Dynamic Rendering".

If a page uses **Server-side Rendering**, the page HTML is generated on
**each request**.

To use Server-side Rendering for a page, you need to `export` an `async`
function called `getServerSideProps`. This function will be called by the
server on every request.

See the [`getServerSideProps` documentation](./get-server-side-props) for
more details.
