There are two basic ways to run Postgres locally:

1. Natively on your computer
2. Via Docker

Most people run Postgres natively without Docker as it's simpler, runs all
the time in the background, and because Docker uses extra resources.

## Natively on your computer {#natively-on-your-computer}

### On Mac {#on-mac}

There are two very popular options.

#### Install via Homebrew

1. Make sure you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed.
2. Run `brew install postgresql`
3. Run `brew services start postgresql`

And that's it!

#### Install via Postgres.app

1. Go to [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com/)
2. Download and install the app
3. Open the app and click "initalize" to create a new server

And then you are good to go!

### On Windows {#on-windows}

The easiest way is to download and run the installer from
[the Postgres website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/).

## Via Docker {#via-docker}

1. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file inside the root of your project with
   the following content

```yaml
version: "3.7"

services:
  db:
    image: postgres:latest
    volumes:
      - data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    env_file: ./.env.local #Here we are using the already existing .env.local file
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"

  db-test:
    image: postgres:latest
    env_file: ./.env.test.local
    ports:
      - 5433:5432

volumes:
  data:
```

2. Inside your `.env.local` file add 3 new environment variables which are
   required by docker

```bash
POSTGRES_USER=your_user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password
POSTGRES_DB=your_database_name
```

Given these values, update `DATABASE_URL` in `.env.local` to something
similar like
`postgresql://your_user:your_password@localhost:5432/your_database_name`
and in `.env.test.local` to
`postgresql://your_user:your_password@localhost:5433/your_database_name`

Please note that test database is using port `5433` instead of `5432`

3. Modify your `package.json` to start the database before Blitz

```json
"scripts": {
    "predev": "docker-compose up -d",
    "dev": "blitz dev",
}
```

4. Start your new database and get it to the latest version of your
   migrations by running `docker-compose up -d` and
   `blitz prisma migrate dev`.
