### `enhancePrisma(PrismaClient)` {#enhance-prisma-prisma-client}

`enhancePrisma` is a little wrapper that makes integration with Blitz apps
a bit nicer.

- It ensures you only have one instance of Prisma Client in your
  application to reduce the number of database connections. But in
  serverless deployment, you will still have one instance per serverless
  function.
- It ensures Prisma client is not used in your client bundle.
- It adds a `db.$reset() => Promise<void>` function for use in tests like
  this:
- It automatically closes the database connection at the end of your tests
  if you are using [the Blitz jest preset](./testing)

```ts
beforeEach(async () => {
  await db.$reset()
})
```

#### Example Usage

```ts
import { enhancePrisma } from "blitz"
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client"

const EnhancedPrisma = enhancePrisma(PrismaClient)

export * from "@prisma/client"
export default new EnhancedPrisma()
```
