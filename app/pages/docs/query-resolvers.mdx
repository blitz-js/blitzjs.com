Blitz queries are plain, asynchronous JavaScript functions that always run
on the server.

**1. Queries must be inside a `queries` folder. All of the following are
valid:**

- `app/queries/getProject.ts`
- `app/projects/queries/getProject.ts`
- `app/admin/projects/queries/getProject.ts`

**2. Queries must export a function as the default export**

You can write any normal Node.js code here, including database access and
fetching from third-party APIs.

#### Arguments

- `input: any`
  - The first argument is anything you need for your query. There are no
    special requirements.
- `ctx: Ctx`
  - This context object is automatically provided by Blitz at run time.
    This is used by [HTTP Middleware](./middleware) to provide data or
    functions to your query. For example, authentication middleware can
    provide `ctx.session` with all the data about the current user
    session.

#### Example Query

```ts
// app/products/queries/getProduct.tsx
import {Ctx} from "blitz"
import db, {FindOneProjectArgs} from "db"

type GetProjectInput = {
  where: FindOneProjectArgs["where"]
}

export default async function getProject(
  {where}: GetProjectInput,
  ctx: Ctx,
) {
  // Can do any processing, fetching from other APIs, etc

  const project = await db.project.findOne({where})

  return project
}
```

_We automatically alias the root of your project, so `import db from 'db'`
is importing `<project_root>/db/index.ts`_

Next, [read these docs](./query-usage) to see how to use these queries in
your components.
