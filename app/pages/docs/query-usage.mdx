## In a React Component {#in-a-react-component}

To use one of [your Blitz queries](./query-resolvers), call the `useQuery`
hook with:

1. Your query resolver
2. The input arguments for your query function
3. Optionally, a configuration object.

It returns this tuple array,`[queryResult, queryExtras]`, where
`queryResult` is exactly what's returned from your query function.

`useQuery` is built on
[`react-query`](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-query), so it
automatically provides awesome features such as automatic caching and
revalidation.

```ts
import { useQuery } from "@blitzjs/rpc"
import getProject from "app/projects/queries/getProject"

function App() {
  const [project] = useQuery(getProject, { where: { id: 1 } })
}
```

For complete details, see the [`useQuery` documentation](./use-query).

You may be wondering how that can work since it's importing server code
into your component: At build time, the direct function import is swapped
out with a network call. So the query function code is never included in
your client code.

### Defaults to Keep in Mind {#defaults-to-keep-in-mind}

Out of the box, `useQuery` and the other query hooks are configured with
**aggressive but reasonable** defaults. **Sometimes these defaults can
catch new users off guard or make learning/debugging difficult if they are
unknown by the user.**:

- Query results that are _currently rendered on the screen_ will become
  "stale" immediately after they are resolved and will be refetched
  automatically in the background when they are rendered or used again. To
  change this, you can alter the default `staleTime` for queries to
  something other than `0` milliseconds.
- Query results that become unused (all instances of the query are
  unmounted) will still be cached in case they are used again for a
  default of 5 minutes before they are garbage collected. To change this,
  you can alter the default `cacheTime` for queries to something other
  than `1000 * 60 * 5` milliseconds.
- Stale queries will automatically be refetched in the background **when
  the browser window is refocused by the user or when the browser
  reconnects**. You can disable this using the `refetchOnWindowFocus` and
  `refetchOnReconnect` options in queries.
- Queries that fail in production because of a network error will silently
  and automatically be retried **3 times, with exponential backoff delay**
  before capturing and displaying an error to the UI. To change this, you
  can alter the default `retry` and `retryDelay` options for queries.
- Query results by default are deep compared to detect if data has
  actually changed and if not, the data reference remains unchanged to
  better help with value stabilization with regards to useMemo and
  useCallback. The default deep compare function use here
  (`config.isDataEqual`) only supports comparing JSON-compatible
  primitives. If you are dealing with any non-json compatible values in
  your query responses OR are seeing performance issues with the deep
  compare function, you should probably disable it
  (`config.isDataEqual = () => false`) or customize it to better fit your
  needs.

### Options {#options}

See [the `useQuery` documentation](./use-query) for a full list of
possible options.

### Dependent Queries {#dependent-queries}

Dependent queries are queries that depend on previous ones to finish
before they can execute. To do this, use the enabled option to tell a
query when it is ready to turn on:

```tsx
const [user] = useQuery(getUser, { where: { id: props.query.id } })
const [projects] = useQuery(getProjects, { where: { userId: user.id } }, { enabled: user }))
```

### Pagination {#pagination}

Use the [`usePaginatedQuery`](./use-paginated-query) hook

### Infinite Loading {#infinite-loading}

Use the [`useInfiniteQuery`](./use-infinite-query) hook

### Prefetching {#prefetching}

All queries are automatically cached, so both of the following will cache
the `getProject` query.

```ts
import { invoke } from "@blitzjs/rpc"

const project = await invoke(getProject, { where: { id: props.id } })
```

```tsx
<a onMouseEnter={() => invoke(getProject, { where: { id: props.id } })}>
  View Project
</a>
```

Blitz also supports prefetching multiple queries on the server and then
dehydrating those queries to the internal query client. This allows Blitz
to prerender markup that is immediately available on page load. Once
JavaScript is available in the browser, Blitz will hydrate those queries
and refetch them if they have become stale since the time they were
rendered on the server.

The following example demonstrates how prefetching works in Blitz.

```tsx
import { gSSP } from "app/blitz-server"
import getProject from "app/projects/queries/getProject"

export const getServerSideProps = gSSP(async ({ ctx }) => {
  // IMPORTANT: the second argument to prefetchBlitzQuery must exactly match the second argument to useQuery down below
  await context.prefetchBlitzQuery(getProject, {
    where: { id: context.params?.projectId },
  })

  return { props: {} }
})

function ProjectPage(props) {
  const [project] = useQuery(getProject, { where: { id: props.id } })
  return <div>{project.name}</div>
}

export default ProjectPage
```

To ensure data is not shared between users and requests, a new query
client is created for each page request. You can prefetch your data by
invoking the `prefetchBlitzQuery` method which is available on the `ctx`
object, passing in the resolver along with any relevant input arguments.
Once the data has been fetched, Blitz handles dehydrating the queries to
the query client.

### Query Cancellation {#query-cancellation}

Blitz supports the default React Query's way to cancel queries. You can
read more about it
[here](https://react-query-v2.tanstack.com/guides/query-cancellation).

You can also manually cancel queries by using `cancelQueries` method:

```tsx
import { getQueryClient, getQueryKey, useQuery } from "@blitzjs/rpc"

const [data] = useQuery(getTodos)

return (
  <button
    onClick={(e) => {
      e.preventDefault()
      getQueryClient.cancelQueries(getQueryKey(getTodos))
    }}
  >
    Cancel
  </button>
)
```

## On the Server {#on-the-server}
<Card type="info">
In `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps`, a query & mutation function can be called directly.
</Card>


### `getStaticProps` {#get-static-props}

```tsx
import getProject from "app/projects/queries/getProject"
import { gSP } from "app/blitz-server"

export const getStaticProps = gSP(async ({ params, ctx }) => {
  const project = await getProject({
    where: { id: context.params?.projectId },
  })
  return { props: { project } }
})

function ProjectPage({ project }) {
  return <div>{project.name}</div>
}

export default ProjectPage
```

### `getServerSideProps` {#get-server-side-props}

```tsx
import getProject from "app/projects/queries/getProject"
import { gSSP } from "app/blitz-server"

export const getServerSideProps = gSSP(async ({ params, ctx }) => {
  const project = await getProject({ 
    where: { id: params.projectId }
  }),

  return { props: { project } }
})

function ProjectPage({ project }) {
  return <div>{project.name}</div>
}

export default ProjectPage
```
