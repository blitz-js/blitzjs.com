title: Route Manifest
sidebar_label: Route Manifest

Blitz generates a _Route Manifest_ for you. It allows you to refer to a
page by _name_ instead of _location_:

```ts
// Assume you have a page at app/pages/products/[productId].tsx
export default function ProductPage() { ...

// You can then use Routes...
import { Link, Routes }Â from "blitz"

// ...to refer to it by name...
<Link href={Routes.ProductsPage({ productId: 123 })} />

// ...instead of looking up the location!
<Link href={`/products/${123}`} />
```

The _Route Manifest_ is a purely optional feature. It has some advantages,
though:

- improved expressiveness
- simplifies moving pages to new locations

  Take a look at your <code>node_modules/.blitz</code> directory! It's very
  similar to how <a href="https://www.prisma.io">Prisma</a> works, where the
  inspiration for this feature comes from.
