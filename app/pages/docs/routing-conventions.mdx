title: Routing Conventions
sidebar_label: Conventions
---

We copied the conventions from Ruby on Rails, where it has stood the test
of time. The Blitz CLI uses these conventions for code scaffolding. If you
don't like them, you are free to deviate and do anything you want.

- Entity names are plural
- Each of the following have their own page: entity index, single entity
  show page, new entity page, and edit entity page
- `entityId` is used from the dynamic url slug

Example: You have a `Project` model and a `Task` model which belongs to a
`Project`. Your routes will be:

| URL Path                                  | File                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| /projects                                 | app/projects/pages/projects/index.js                        |
| /projects/new                             | app/projects/pages/projects/new.js                          |
| /projects/[projectId]                     | app/projects/pages/projects/[projectId].js                  |
| /projects/[projectId]/edit                | app/projects/pages/projects/[projectId]/edit.js             |
|                                           |                                                             |
| /projects/[projectId]/tasks               | app/tasks/pages/projects/[projectId]/tasks/index.js         |
| /projects/[projectId]/tasks/new           | app/tasks/pages/projects/[projectId]/tasks/new.js           |
| /projects/[projectId]/tasks/[taskId]      | app/tasks/pages/projects/[projectId]/tasks/[taskId].js      |
