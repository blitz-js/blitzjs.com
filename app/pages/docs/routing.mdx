Blitz uses a file-system based router that's built on
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction).

- All components in `pages/` are mapped to a URL.
  ([Pages documentation](./pages))
- All http handlers in `api/` are mapped to a URL.
  ([API routes documentation](./api-routes))
- Queries and mutations are automatically exposed as an API endpoint
  - The `app/projects/queries/getProjects.js` query is exposed at
    `/api/projects/queries/getProjects`
  - See the [RPC Specification](./rpc-specification) for more details

### Index routes {#index-routes}

The router will automatically route files named `index` to the root of the
directory.

- `app/pages/index.js` → `/`
- `app/pages/blog/index.js` → `/blog`

### Nested routes {#nested-routes}

The router supports nested files. If you create a nested folder structure
files will be automatically routed in the same way still.

- `app/pages/blog/first-post.js` → `/blog/first-post`
- `app/pages/dashboard/settings/username.js` →
  `/dashboard/settings/username`

### Dynamic route segments {#dynamic-route-segments}

To match a dynamic segment you can use the bracket syntax. This allows you
to match named parameters.

- `app/pages/blog/[slug].js` → `/blog/:slug` (`/blog/hello-world`)
- `app/pages/[username]/settings.js` → `/:username/settings`
  (`/foo/settings`)
- `app/pages/post/[...all].js` → `/post/*` (`/post/2020/id/title`)

Consider the following page `app/pages/post/[pid].js`:

```jsx
import {useParam} from "blitz"

const Post = () => {
  const pid = useParam("pid")

  return <p>Post: {pid}</p>
}

export default Post
```

Any route like `/post/1`, `/post/abc`, etc. will be matched by
`app/pages/post/[pid].js`. The matched path parameter will be sent as a
query parameter to the page, and it will be merged with the other query
parameters.

For example, the route `/post/abc` will have the following `query` object:

```json
{"pid": "abc"}
```

Similarly, the route `/post/abc?foo=bar` will have the following `query`
object:

```json
{"foo": "bar", "pid": "abc"}
```

However, route parameters will override query parameters with the same
name. For example, the route `/post/abc?pid=123` will have the following
`query` object:

```json
{"pid": "abc"}
```

Multiple dynamic route segments work the same way. The page
`app/pages/post/[pid]/[comment].js` will match the route
`/post/abc/a-comment` and its `query` object will be:

```json
{"pid": "abc", "comment": "a-comment"}
```

### Catch all routes {#catch-all-routes}

Dynamic routes can be extended to catch all paths by adding three dots
(`...`) inside the brackets. For example:

- `app/pages/post/[...slug].js` matches `/post/a`, but also `/post/a/b`,
  `/post/a/b/c` and so on.

> **Note**: You can use names other than `slug`, such as: `[...param]`

Matched parameters will be sent as a query parameter (`slug` in the
example) to the page, and it will always be an array, so, the path
`/post/a` will have the following `query` object:

```json
{"slug": ["a"]}
```

And in the case of `/post/a/b`, and any other matching path, new
parameters will be added to the array, like so:

```json
{"slug": ["a", "b"]}
```

### Optional catch all routes {#optional-catch-all-routes}

Catch all routes can be made optional by including the parameter in double
brackets (`[[...slug]]`).

For example, `app/pages/post/[[...slug]].js` will match `/post`,
`/post/a`, `/post/a/b`, and so on.

The `query` objects are as follows:

```json
{ } // GET `/post` (empty object)
{ "slug": ["a"] } // `GET /post/a` (single-element array)
{ "slug": ["a", "b"] } // `GET /post/a/b` (multi-element array)
```

## Caveats {#caveats}

- Predefined routes take precedence over dynamic routes, and dynamic
  routes over catch all routes. Take a look at the following examples:
  - `app/pages/post/create.js` - Will match `/post/create`
  - `app/pages/post/[pid].js` - Will match `/post/1`, `/post/abc`, etc.
    But not `/post/create`
  - `app/pages/post/[...slug].js` - Will match `/post/1/2`, `/post/a/b/c`,
    etc. But not `/post/create`, `/post/abc`
- Pages that are statically optimized by
  [Automatic Static Optimization](./pages#automatic-static-optimization)
  will be hydrated without their route parameters provided, i.e `query`
  will be an empty object (`{}`).

  After hydration, Blitz will trigger an update to your application to
  provide the route parameters in the `query` object.
