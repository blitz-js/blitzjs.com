You can configure certain RPC aspects within your `next.config.js` file
inside the blitz property.

## Changing resolverPath option {#custom-resolver-path}

To change how every file path is resolved, you can set the `resolverPath`
option inside `next.config.js`.

```ts
module.exports = withBlitz({
  blitz: {
    resolverPath: "queries|mutations",
  },
})

// Or with a custom function
module.exports = withBlitz({
  blitz: {
    resolverPath: (filePath) => {
      return filePath.replace("app/", "") // Removes `app/` from the path
    },
  },
})
```

There are three options to determine how the RPC path is resolved during
build.

- `queries|mutations` (default)
  - Use the `queries` or `mutations` folder as the root
- `root`
  - Uses the path starting from the root of the project
- Custom function
  - This function gets called for every file path that needs to be
    resolved.

Example output:

```
File: src/products/queries/getProduct.ts
"queries|mutations" URL: /api/rpc/getProduct
"root" URL: src/products/queries/getProduct

File: src/products/mutations/createProduct.ts
"queries|mutations" URL: /api/rpc/createProduct
"root" URL: src/products/mutations/createProduct

File: src/products/mutations/v2/createProduct.ts
"queries|mutations" URL: /api/rpc/v2/createProduct
"root" URL: src/products/mutations/v2/createProduct
```

## Resolvers in a separate folder {#resolvers-separate-folder}

Inside the `blitz` property add the param `includeRPCFolders` as an array
of relative path folders from your Blitz root folder. For example:

```ts
module.exports = withBlitz({
  blitz: {
    includeRPCFolders: ["../../<YOUR DIRECTORY PATH>"],
  },
})
```

  Your resolvers still need to be placed in `queries` or `mutations`
  folders.
