You can configure certain RPC aspects within your `next.config.js` file
inside the blitz property.

## Changing resolverPath option {#custom-resolver-path}

To change how every file path is resolved, you can set the `resolverPath`
option inside `next.config.js`.

```ts
module.exports = withBlitz({
  blitz: {
    resolverPath: "queries|mutations",
  },
})

// Or with a custom function
module.exports = withBlitz({
  blitz: {
    resolverPath: (filePath) => {
      return filePath.replace("app/", "") // Removes `app/` from the path
    },
  },
})
```

There are three options to determine how the RPC path is resolved during
build.

- `queries|mutations` (default)
  - Use the `queries` or `mutations` folder as the root
- `root`
  - Uses the path starting from the root of the project
- Custom function
  - This function gets called for every file path that needs to be
    resolved.

Example output:

```
File: src/products/queries/getProduct.ts
"queries|mutations" URL: /api/rpc/getProduct
"root" URL: src/products/queries/getProduct

File: src/products/mutations/createProduct.ts
"queries|mutations" URL: /api/rpc/createProduct
"root" URL: src/products/mutations/createProduct

File: src/products/mutations/v2/createProduct.ts
"queries|mutations" URL: /api/rpc/v2/createProduct
"root" URL: src/products/mutations/v2/createProduct
```

## Resolvers in a separate folder {#resolvers-separate-folder}

Inside the `blitz` property add the param `includeRPCFolders` as an array
of relative path folders from your Blitz root folder. For example:

```ts
module.exports = withBlitz({
  blitz: {
    includeRPCFolders: ["../../<YOUR DIRECTORY PATH>"],
  },
})
```

<Card type="note">
  Your resolvers still need to be placed in `queries` or `mutations`
  folders.
</Card>

## Logging Setup {#blitz-rpc-logging}

In your `[[...blitz]].ts` api file you can see the following settings in the `rpcHandler`
```ts
logging?: {
  /**
   * allowList Represents the list of routes for which logging should be enabled
   * If whiteList is defined then only those routes will be logged
   */
  allowList?: string[]
  /**
   * blockList Represents the list of routes for which logging should be disabled
   * If blockList is defined then all routes except those will be logged
   */
  blockList?: string[]
  /**
   * verbose Represents the flag to enable/disable logging
   * If verbose is true then Blitz RPC will log the input and output of each resolver
   */
  verbose?: boolean
  /**
   * disablelevel Represents the flag to enable/disable logging for a particular level
   */
  disablelevel?: "debug" | "info"
}
```
<Card type="note">
  Blitz RPC defaults to:
  - The `input` and `resolver completion time` will be logged with the `info` level.
  - The `result` and `next.js serialization time` will be logged with the `debug` level.
</Card>

```ts
import { rpcHandler } from "@blitzjs/rpc"
import { api } from "src/blitz-server"

export default api(
  rpcHandler({
    onError: console.log,
    formatError: (error) => {
      error.message = `FormatError handler: ${error.message}`
      return error
    },
    logging: {
        ...
    }
  })
)
```

Example:

```ts
export default api(
  rpcHandler({
    onError: console.log,
    formatError: (error) => {
      error.message = `FormatError handler: ${error.message}`
      return error
    },
    logging: {
      verbose: true,
      blockList: ["getCurrentUser", ...], //just write the resolver name [which is the resolver file name]
    },
  })
)
```

This is will enable verbose Blitz RPC logging for all resolvers except the resolvers `getCurrentUser` and others mentioned in the `blockList`
