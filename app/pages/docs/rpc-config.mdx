You can configure certain RPC aspects within your `next.config.js` file
inside the blitz property.

## Changing resolverPath option {#custom-resolver-path}

To change how every file path is resolved, you can set the `resolverPath`
option inside `next.config.js`.

```ts
module.exports = withBlitz({
  blitz: {
    resolverPath: "queries|mutations",
  },
})

// Or with a custom function
module.exports = withBlitz({
  blitz: {
    resolverPath: (filePath) => {
      return filePath.replace("app/", "") // Removes `app/` from the path
    },
  },
})
```

There are three options to determine how the RPC path is resolved during
build.

- `queries|mutations` (default)
  - Use the `queries` or `mutations` folder as the root
- `root`
  - Uses the path starting from the root of the project
- Custom function
  - This function gets called for every file path that needs to be
    resolved.

Example output:

```
File: src/products/queries/getProduct.ts
"queries|mutations" URL: /api/rpc/getProduct
"root" URL: src/products/queries/getProduct

File: src/products/mutations/createProduct.ts
"queries|mutations" URL: /api/rpc/createProduct
"root" URL: src/products/mutations/createProduct

File: src/products/mutations/v2/createProduct.ts
"queries|mutations" URL: /api/rpc/v2/createProduct
"root" URL: src/products/mutations/v2/createProduct
```

## Resolvers in a separate folder {#resolvers-separate-folder}

Inside the `blitz` property add the param `includeRPCFolders` as an array
of relative path folders from your Blitz root folder. For example:

```ts
module.exports = withBlitz({
  blitz: {
    includeRPCFolders: ["../../<YOUR DIRECTORY PATH>"],
  },
})
```

<Card type="note">
  Your resolvers still need to be placed in `queries` or `mutations`
  folders.
</Card>

## Logging Setup {#blitz-rpc-logging}

In your `[[...blitz]].ts` api file you can see the following settings in
the `rpcHandler`

```ts
logging?: {
  /**
   * allowList Represents the list of routes for which logging should be enabled
   * If whiteList is defined then only those routes will be logged
   */
  allowList?: string[]
  /**
   * blockList Represents the list of routes for which logging should be disabled
   * If blockList is defined then all routes except those will be logged
   */
  blockList?: string[]
  /**
   * verbose Represents the flag to enable/disable logging
   * If verbose is true then Blitz RPC will log the input and output of each resolver
   */
  verbose?: boolean
  /**
   * disablelevel Represents the flag to enable/disable logging for a particular level
   */
  disablelevel?: "debug" | "info"
}
```

<Card type="note">
  Blitz RPC defaults to: 
  - `verbose` to be true if it not configured. 
  - The `input` and `resolver completion time` will be logged with the
  `info` level. 
  - The `result` and `next.js serialization time` will be
  logged with the `debug` level.

##### In App Router (recommended)

#### `rpcAppHandler`:

This function acts as the handler for all the queries and mutations in the
next.js app directory.

#### Arguments:

- `options` (optional): An object with the following properties:
  - `onInvokeError` (optional): A function that will be called when an
    error occurs during the invocation of a resolver.
  - `formatError` (optional): A function that will be called to format the
    error before sending it to the client.
  - `logging` (optional): An object with the following properties:
    - `allowList` (optional): An array of resolvers that should be logged.
    - `blockList` (optional): An array of resolvers that should not be
      logged.
    - `verbose` (optional): A boolean that determines whether verbose
      logging should be enabled.
    - `disablelevel` (optional): A string that determines which level of
      logging should be disabled.

#### Returns:

An object with the handlers that handle the GET, POST, and HEAD requests.

#### Example:

```ts
// app/api/rpc/[[...blitz]]/route.ts
export default api(
  rpcAppHandler({
    onError: console.log,
    formatError: (error) => {
      error.message = `FormatError handler: ${error.message}`
      return error
    },
    logging: {
      verbose: true,
      blockList: ["getCurrentUser", ...]
    },
  })
)
```

##### In Pages Router

#### `rpcHandler`:

This function acts as the handler for all the queries and mutations in the
next.js pages directory.

#### Arguments:

- `options` (optional): An object with the following properties:
  - `onInvokeError` (optional): A function that will be called when an
    error occurs during the invocation of a resolver.
  - `formatError` (optional): A function that will be called to format the
    error before sending it to the client.
  - `logging` (optional): An object with the following properties:
    - `allowList` (optional): An array of resolvers that should be logged.
    - `blockList` (optional): An array of resolvers that should not be
      logged.
    - `verbose` (optional): A boolean that determines whether verbose
      logging should be enabled.
    - `disablelevel` (optional): A string that determines which level of
      logging should be disabled.

#### Returns:

A function that returns the handler for the RPC API.

```ts
// pages router
// src/pages/api/rpc/[[...blitz]].ts
export default api(
  rpcHandler({
    onError: console.log,
    formatError: (error) => {
      error.message = `FormatError handler: ${error.message}`
      return error
    },
    logging: {
      verbose: true,
      blockList: ["getCurrentUser", ...], //just write the resolver name [which is the resolver file name]
    },
  })
)
```

This is will enable verbose Blitz RPC logging for all resolvers except the
resolvers `getCurrentUser` and others mentioned in the `blockList`
