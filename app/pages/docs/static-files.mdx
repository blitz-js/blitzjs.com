Blitz can serve static files, like images, under a folder called `public`
in the root directory. Files inside `public` can then be referenced by
your code starting from the base URL (`/`).

For example, if you add an image to `public/my-image.png`, the following
code will access the image:

```jsx
function MyImage() {
  return <img src="/my-image.png" alt="my image" />
}

export default MyImage
```

This folder is also useful for `robots.txt`, Google Site Verification, and
any other static files (including `.html`)!

> **Note**: Don't name the `public` directory anything else. The name
> cannot be changed and is the only directory used to serve static assets.

> **Note**: Be sure to not have a static file with the same name as a file
> in a `pages/` directory, as this will result in an error.
