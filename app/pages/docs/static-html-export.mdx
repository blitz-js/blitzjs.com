[`blitz export`](cli-export) allows you to export your app to static HTML,
which can be run standalone without the need of a Node.js server.

The exported app supports only some features of Blitz, like
[dynamic routes](routing#dynamic-route-segments), prefetching, preloading
and dynamic imports. It does **not** support queries / mutations,
authentication or database access.

`blitz export` works by prerendering all pages to HTML. For dynamic
routes, your page can export a [`getStaticPaths`](get-static-paths)
function to let the exporter know which HTML pages to generate for that
route.

`blitz export` is intended for scenarios where **none** of your pages have
server-side or incremental data requirements (though statically-rendered
pages can still fetch data on the client side normally).

If you're looking to make a hybrid site where only some pages are
prerendered to static HTML, Blitz already does that automatically for you!
If your page doesn't use `getServerSideProps`, then it will be a static
HTML page.

`blitz export` also causes features like
[Incremental Static Generation and Regeneration](get-static-props#incremental-static-regeneration)
to be disabled, as they require `blitz start` or a serverless deployment
to function.

## How to use it {#how-to-use-it}

Develop your app as you normally do with Blitz. Then run:

```bash
blitz build
blitz export
```

For that you may want to update the scripts in your `package.json` like
this:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "blitz build && blitz export"
}
```

And run it with:

```bash
yarn build
```

Then you'll have a static version of your app in the out directory.

By default, `blitz export` doesn't require any configuration. It will
output a static HTML file for each page in your pages directory (or more
for [dynamic routes](routing#dynamic-route-segments), where it will call
`getStaticPaths` and generate pages based on the result). For more
advanced scenarios, you can define a parameter called
[`exportPathMap`](blitz-config#export-path-map) in your blitz.config.js
file to configure exactly which pages will be generated.

## Deployment {#deployment}

By default, `blitz export` will generate an out directory, which can be
served by any static hosting service or CDN.

## Caveats {#caveats}

- `getServerSideProps` cannot be used within pages because the method
  requires a server. Consider using `getStaticProps` instead.
- The `fallback: true` mode of `getStaticPaths` is not supported when
  using `blitz export`.
- API Routes, Queries, and Mutations are not supported by this method
  because they can't be prerendered to HTML.
- Internationalized Routing is not supported as it requires server-side
  routing.
- The Image component's default loader is not supported when using
  `blitz export`. However, other loader options will work.
