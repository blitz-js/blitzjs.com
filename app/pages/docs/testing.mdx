The `blitz` dependency also automatically installs and configures `jest`,
`@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/react-hooks`, and
`@testing-libary/jest-dom` for you.

## Jest {#jest}

[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) is a delightful testing framework that's simple
to use. To run tests in your app, you will run `jest` or `jest --watch`
from the terminal.

To make a new test, make a file named `something.test.ts` (or `.js`,
`.tsx`, etc). Here's an example:

```ts
import something from "./somewhere"

it("does something", () => {
  const result = something()
  expect(result).toBe(true)
})
```

> [read the Jest documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/using-matchers)

### Jest Config {#jest-config}

Blitz provides a Jest preset that configures lots of complex things for
you, including Typescript support.

If you need to
[customize the jest config](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration), you
can do so in `jest.config.js`.

```ts
// jest.config.js
module.exports = {
  preset: "blitz",
}
```

### Client vs Server Environments {#client-vs-server-environments}

The following test files will run in the Jest server environment:

- `*.test.*` files inside an `api`, `queries`, or `mutations` folder
- `*.server.test.*` files

All other files will run in the Jest client environment (with jsdom).

## @testing-library {#testing-library}

[@testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/) is a family of
packages that help you test UI components in a user-centric way. It's a better
alternative to Enzyme, if you've used that in the past.

The following packages are installed for you. Refer to their documentation
as needed.

- [@testing-library/dom](https://testing-library.com/docs/dom-testing-library/intro)
- [@testing-library/jest-dom](https://testing-library.com/docs/ecosystem-jest-dom)
- [@testing-library/react](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)
- [@testing-library/react-hooks](https://react-hooks-testing-library.com/)

## Testing Utilities {#testing-utilities}

Blitz provides some basic testing utilities in the generated
`test/utils.tsx` file. These are intended for use with Jest and React
Testing Library to allow advanced configuration for your testing
environment. Customizing this file can be useful for testing things like
global providers as well as certain parts of your app which Blitz handles
internally such as routing and data querying.

### `BlitzProvider` {#blitz-provider}

This component works as the global provider for data queries and mutations
in your tests. Internally, it wraps the `QueryClient` component from
`react-query` and adds some additional configuration options.

`BlitzProvider` accepts the following props:

- `client` - The global query client used by React Query. By default the
  `queryClient` exported from `blitz` is used unless you override it.

- `contextSharing` - Controls whether or not the provider context can be
  shared across multiple applications. This can be useful when working in
  certain environments such as micro-frontends. Defaults to `false`.

- `dehydratedState` - The server state passed along to the application
  containing the results of server-side queries. Useful for testing
  queries that need to be
  [prerendered in markup and hydrated on the client](https://react-query.tanstack.com/guides/ssr#using-hydration).
