The `blitz` dependency also automatically installs and configures `jest`,
`@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/react-hooks`, and
`@testing-libary/jest-dom` for you.

## Jest {#jest}

[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) is a delightful testing framework that's simple
to use. To run tests in your app, you will run `jest` or `jest --watch`
from the terminal.

To make a new test, make a file named `something.test.ts` (or `.js`,
`.tsx`, etc). Here's an example:

```ts
import something from "./somewhere"

it("does something", () => {
  const result = something()
  expect(result).toBe(true)
})
```

### Jest Config {#jest-config}

Blitz provides a Jest preset that configures lots of complex things for
you, including Typescript support.

If you need to
[customize the jest config](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration), you
can do so in `jest.config.js`.

```ts
// jest.config.js
module.exports = {
  preset: "blitz",
}
```

### Client vs Server Environments {#client-vs-server-environments}

The following test files will run in the Jest server environment:

- `*.test.*` files inside an `api`, `queries`, or `mutations` folder
- `*.server.test.*` files

All other files will run in the Jest client environment (with jsdom).

## @testing-library {#testing-library}

[@testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/) is family of
packages helps you test UI components in a user-centric way. It's a better
alternative to Enzyme, if you've used that in the past.

The following packages are installed for you. Refer to their documentation
as needed.

- [@testing-library/dom](https://testing-library.com/docs/dom-testing-library/intro)
- [@testing-library/jest-dom](https://testing-library.com/docs/ecosystem-jest-dom)
- [@testing-library/react](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)
- [@testing-library/react-hooks](https://react-hooks-testing-library.com/)
