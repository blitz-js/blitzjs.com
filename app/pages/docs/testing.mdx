The `blitz` dependency also automatically installs and configures `jest`,
`@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/react-hooks`, and
`@testing-library/jest-dom` for you.

## Jest {#jest}

[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) is a delightful testing framework that's simple
to use. To run tests in your app, you will run `jest` or `jest --watch`
from the terminal.

To make a new test, make a file named `something.test.ts` (or `.js`,
`.tsx`, etc). Here's an example:

```ts
import something from "./somewhere"

it("does something", () => {
  const result = something()
  expect(result).toBe(true)
})
```

> For more details on using Jest,
> [read the Jest documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/using-matchers)

### Jest Config {#jest-config}

If you need to
[customize the jest config](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration), you
can do so in `jest.config.js`.

```js
// jest.config.js
const nextJest = require("@blitzjs/next/jest")

const createJestConfig = nextJest({
  dir: "./",
})

const customJestConfig = {
  testEnvironment: "jest-environment-jsdom",
}

module.exports = createJestConfig(customJestConfig)
```

### Client vs Server Environments {#client-vs-server-environments}

The following test files will run in the Jest server environment:

- `*.test.*` files inside an `api`, `queries`, or `mutations` folder
- `*.server.test.*` files

All other files will run in the Jest client environment (with jsdom).

## @testing-library {#testing-library}

[@testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/) is a family of
packages that help you test UI components in a user-centric way. It's a
better alternative to Enzyme, if you've used that in the past.

The following packages are installed for you. Refer to their documentation
as needed.

- [@testing-library/dom](https://testing-library.com/docs/dom-testing-library/intro)
- [@testing-library/jest-dom](https://testing-library.com/docs/ecosystem-jest-dom)
- [@testing-library/react](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)
- [@testing-library/react-hooks](https://react-hooks-testing-library.com/)

## Testing Utilities {#testing-utilities}

Blitz provides some basic testing utilities in the generated
`test/utils.tsx` file. These are intended for use with Jest and React
Testing Library to allow advanced configuration for your testing
environment. Customizing this file can be useful for testing things like
global providers as well as certain parts of your app which Blitz handles
internally such as routing and data querying.

### `BlitzProvider` {#blitz-provider}

This component works as the global provider for data queries and mutations
in your tests. Internally, it wraps the `QueryClient` component from
`react-query` and adds some additional configuration options.

`BlitzProvider` accepts the following props:

- `client` - The global query client used by React Query. By default the
  `queryClient` exported from `blitz` is used unless you override it.

- `contextSharing` - Controls whether or not the provider context can be
  shared across multiple applications. This can be useful when working in
  certain environments such as micro-frontends. Defaults to `false`.

- `dehydratedState` - The server state passed along to the application
  containing the results of server-side queries. Useful for testing
  queries that need to be
  [prerendered in markup and hydrated on the client](https://react-query.tanstack.com/guides/ssr#using-hydration).

## End-to-end testing with Cypress {#e2e-cypress}

[Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) is a front-end testing framework that
enables testing options for both unit tests and integration tests.

If you plan to integrate it into your Blitz application, you can look at
our
[example with a Cypress setup](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/tree/canary/examples/cypress).
It includes a simple factory pattern, a command for creating and logging
in a user, and a few example tests.

<!--
## Isolated mutation/query testing {#query-testing}

If you want to test your mutations/queries in an isolated manner, you will
need to mock the ctx object:

```ts
// test/createMockContext.ts
import {
  Ctx,
  getSession,
  MiddlewareRequest as Req,
  MiddlewareResponse as Res,
} from "blitz"
import httpMocks from "node-mocks-http"
import { User } from "db"

// This import is crucial, as it modifies global state by calling sessionMiddleware
// Most importantly, this sets the isAuthorized method in global.sessionConfig
import "../blitz.config"
import { getPublicSessionData } from "../app/auth/utils/getPublicSessionData"

interface CreateMockContextOptions {
  user?: User
  reqOptions?: httpMocks.RequestOptions
  resOptions?: httpMocks.ResponseOptions
}

// Based on https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/issues/2654#issuecomment-904426530
// Creates a mock context for use in tests and scripts. Attempts to make it the
// "real deal" by calling the same initialization logic that creates actual
// session contexts.
export default async function createMockContext<C extends Ctx>({
  user,
  reqOptions,
  resOptions,
}: CreateMockContextOptions = {}) {
  const mocks = httpMocks.createMocks<any, any>(reqOptions, resOptions)
  const mockReq: Req = mocks.req
  const mockRes: Res<C> = mocks.res

  // Ensures the response has the blitzCtx object which is required for
  // authorization checks
  await getSession(mockReq, mockRes)

  // Simulate login by saving public session data
  if (user) {
    // Need to use Object.assign instead of spread operator,
    // because $publicData is readonly (only has a getter)
    // make sure to add **your** session's public data
    Object.assign(mockRes.blitzCtx.session.$publicData, {
      id: user.id,
      role: user.role,
    })
  }

  return { req: mockReq, res: mockRes, ctx: mockRes.blitzCtx }
}
```

Later in your tests you can use it like this:

```ts
import db from "db"
import getUsers from "./getUsers"
import createMockContext from "../../../test/createMockContext"

beforeEach(async () => {
  await db.$reset()
})

describe("getUsers query", () => {
  it("rejects access for regular users", async () => {
    const user = await db.user.create({
      data: {
        email: "user@example.com",
        role: "USER",
      },
    })
    const { ctx } = await createMockContext({ user })

    await expect(async () => {
      await getUsers({}, ctx)
    }).rejects.toThrow("You are not authorized to access this")
  })
})
``` -->
