Blitz.js is used by many people arround the world, and we want them to be
comfortable navigating the documentation and using Blitz.

In the [languages](/languages) page, you'll see the translation progress
of each language. You can click on **Contribute** and create a Pull
Request with your contribution!

If your language isn't being translated and you want to work on it, read
[these instructions](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitzjs.com-translation/blob/main/README.md).
