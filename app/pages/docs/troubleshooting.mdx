## Debug logging {#debug-logging}

If you need a more verbose experience on any Blitz module, for debugging
purpose, you can enable advanced logging using the DEBUG environment
variable.

Blitz internally use [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) package.

For example, if you want to enable the REPL logging you can run the
console like so :

```
DEBUG=blitz:repl blitz console
```

You can also use a wildcard pattern :

```
DEBUG=blitz:* blitz console
```

Here are the namespace used by Blitz :

- blitz:cli
- blitz:config
- blitz:generate
- blitz:generator
- blitz:installer
- blitz:manifest
- blitz:middleware
- blitz:new
- blitz:postinstall
- blitz:repl
- blitz:rpc
- blitz:session
- blitz:utils

### Usage in the browser {#usage-in-the-browser}

You can also have this kind of logging for the client-side part of Blitz.
To do so simply set the local storage variable debug to `blitz:*` or any
namespace used by Blitz and then refresh the page.

```
localStorage.setItem('debug', 'blitz:*')
```

Please also be sure, that the devtools console, has the verbose level
enabled.
