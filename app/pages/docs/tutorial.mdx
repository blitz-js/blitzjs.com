In this tutorial, we’ll walk you through the creation of a basic voting
application.

We’ll assume that you have [Blitz installed](./get-started) already. You
can tell if Blitz is installed, and which version you have by running the
following command in your terminal:

```sh
blitz -v
```

If Blitz is installed, you should see the version of your installation. If
it isn’t, you’ll get an error saying something like “command not found:
blitz”.

## Creating a new app {#creating-a-new-app}

From the command line, `cd` into the folder where you’d like to create
your app, and then run the following command:

```sh
blitz new my-blitz-app
```

Blitz will create a `my-blitz-app` folder in your current folder. You will
be prompted to pick a form library. For this tutorial, select the
recommended library `React Final Form`.

Let’s look at what `blitz new` created:

```

These files are:

- The `app/` folder is a container for most of your project. This is where
  you’ll put any pages or API routes.

- The `app/pages/` folder is the primary pages folder. If you've used
  Next.js you'll immediately notice this is different. In Blitz, you can
  have many `pages` folders and they will be merged together at build
  time.

- The `app/core/` folder is the main place to put components, hooks, etc
  that are used throughout your app.

- `db/` is where your database configuration goes. If you’re writing
  models or checking migrations, this is where to go.

- `public/` is a folder where you will put any static assets. If you have
  images, files, or videos which you want to use in your app, this is
  where to put them.

- `.babelrc.js`, `.env`, etc. ("dotfiles") are configuration files for
  various bits of JavaScript tooling.

- `blitz.config.js` is for advanced custom configuration of Blitz. It's
  the same format as `next.config.js`.

- `tsconfig.json` is our recommended setup for TypeScript.

## The development server {#the-development-server}

Now make sure you are in the `my-blitz-app` folder, if you haven’t
already, and run the following command:

```sh
blitz dev
```

You’ll see the following output on the command line:

```sh
✔ Compiled
Loaded env from /private/tmp/my-blitz-app/.env
warn  - You have enabled experimental feature(s).
warn  - Experimental features are not covered by semver, and may cause unexpected or broken application behavior. Use them at your own risk.

ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000
info  - Using external babel configuration from /my-blitz-app/babel.config.js
event - compiled successfully
```

Now that the server’s running, visit
[localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your web browser. You’ll see
a welcome page, with the Blitz logo. It worked!

## Sign up as a user {#sign-up-as-a-user}

Blitz apps are created with user signup and login already set up! So let's
try it. Click on the **Sign Up** button. Enter any email and password and
click **Create Account**. Then you'll be redirected back to the home page
where you can see your user `id` and `role`.

If you want, you can also try logging out and logging back in. Or click
**Forgot your password?** on the login page to try that flow.

## Write your first page {#write-your-first-page}

Next let's create your first page.

Open the file `app/pages/index.tsx` and replace the contents of the `Home`
component with this:

```tsx
//...

const Home: BlitzPage = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>

      <Suspense fallback="Loading...">
        <UserInfo />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  )
}

//...
```

Save the file and you should see the page update in your browser. You can
add customize this as much as you want. When you’re ready, move on to the
next section.

## Database setup {#database-setup}

Good news, an SQLite database was already set up for you! You can run
`blitz prisma studio` in the terminal to open a web interface where you
can see the data in your database.

Note that when starting your first real project, you may want to use a
more scalable database like PostgreSQL, to avoid the pains of switching
your database down the road. For more information, see
[Database overview](database-overview). For now, we will continue with the
default SQLite database.

## Scaffolding code for our models {#scaffolding-code-for-our-models}

Blitz provides a handy CLI command called [`generate`](./cli-generate) for
scaffolding out boilerplate code. We'll use `generate` to create two
models: `Question` and `Choice`. A `Question` has the text of the question
and a list of choices. A `Choice` has the text of the choice, a vote
count, and an associated question. Blitz will automatically generate an
id, a creation timestamp, and a last updated timestamp for both models.

#### First, we'll generate everything pertaining to the `Question` model:

```sh
blitz generate all question text:string
```

And when prompted, press the **Enter** to run `prisma migrate` which will
update your database schema with the new model. It will ask for a name, so
type something like "add question".

```
CREATE    app/pages/questions/[questionId].tsx
CREATE    app/pages/questions/[questionId]/edit.tsx
CREATE    app/pages/questions/index.tsx
CREATE    app/pages/questions/new.tsx
CREATE    app/questions/components/QuestionForm.tsx
CREATE    app/questions/queries/getQuestion.ts
CREATE    app/questions/queries/getQuestions.ts
CREATE    app/questions/mutations/createQuestion.ts
CREATE    app/questions/mutations/deleteQuestion.ts
CREATE    app/questions/mutations/updateQuestion.ts

✔ Model for 'question' created in schema.prisma:

> model Question {
>   id        Int      @default(autoincrement()) @id
>   createdAt DateTime @default(now())
>   updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
>   text      String
> }

? Run 'prisma migrate dev' to update your database? (Y/n) › true
```

```
Environment variables loaded from .env
Prisma schema loaded from db/schema.prisma
Datasource "db": SQLite database "db.sqlite" at "file:./db.sqlite"

✔ Name of migration … add question
The following migration(s) have been created and applied from new schema changes:

migrations/
  └─ 20210217035805_add_question/
    └─ migration.sql

✔ Generated Prisma Client (2.17.0) to ./node_modules/@prisma/client in 103ms

Everything is now in sync.
```

The `generate` command with a type of `all` generates a model and queries,
mutation and page files. See the [Blitz generate](./cli-generate) page for
a list of available type options.

#### Next we'll generate the `Choice` model with corresponding queries and mutations.

We'll pass a type of `resource` this time as we don't need to generate
pages for the `Choice` model:

```sh
blitz generate resource choice text votes:int:default=0 belongsTo:question
```

Again, hit **Enter** when prompted to run the migration and enter a name
for the migration.

```
CREATE    app/choices/queries/getChoice.ts
CREATE    app/choices/queries/getChoices.ts
CREATE    app/choices/mutations/createChoice.ts
CREATE    app/choices/mutations/deleteChoice.ts
CREATE    app/choices/mutations/updateChoice.ts

✔ Model for 'choice' created in schema.prisma:

> model Choice {
>   id         Int      @default(autoincrement()) @id
>   createdAt  DateTime @default(now())
>   updatedAt  DateTime @updatedAt
>   text       String
>   votes      Int      @default(0)
>   question   Question @relation(fields: [questionId], references: [id])
>   questionId Int
> }

? Run 'prisma migrate dev' to update your database? (Y/n) › true
```

#### Lastly let's update the `Question` model to have a relationship back to `Choice`.

Open `db/schema.prisma` and add `choices Choice[]` to the `Question`
model.

```diff
model Question {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
  text      String
+ choices   Choice[]
}
```

And then run `blitz prisma generate` to update prisma client for that
schema change. This doesn't require a database migration because there's
not an actual field being added to the `Question` model in the database.

## Playing with the Prisma database client {#playing-with-the-prisma-database-client}

Now, let’s hop into the interactive Blitz shell and play around with the
Prisma database client that Blitz gives you. To start the Blitz console,
use this command:

```sh
blitz console
```

Once you’re in the console, explore the database client:

```sh
# No questions are in the system yet.
⚡ > await db.question.findMany()
[]

# Create a new Question:
⚡ > let q = await db.question.create({data: {text: "What's new?"}})
undefined

# See the entire object:
⚡ > q
{
  id: 1,
  createdAt: 2020-06-15T15:06:14.959Z,
  updatedAt: 2020-06-15T15:06:14.959Z,
  text: "What's new?"
}

# Or, access individual values on the object:
⚡ > q.text
"What's new?"

# Change values by using the update function:
⚡ > q = await db.question.update({where: {id: 1}, data: {text: "What's up?"}})
{
  id: 1,
  createdAt: 2020-06-15T15:06:14.959Z,
  updatedAt: 2020-06-15T15:13:17.394Z,
  text: "What's up?"
}

# db.question.findMany() now displays all the questions in the database:
⚡ > await db.question.findMany()
[
  {
    id: 1,
    createdAt: 2020-06-15T15:06:14.959Z,
    updatedAt: 2020-06-15T15:13:17.394Z,
    text: "What's up?"
  }
]
```

## Update generated code for our model attributes {#update-generated-code-for-our-model-attributes}

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
:::info
Before running the app again, we need to customize some of the
code that has been generated. Ultimately, these fixes will not be needed -
but for now, we need to work around a couple outstanding issues.
:::
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

The generated page content does not currently use the actual model
attributes you defined during generation. It will soon, but in the
meantime, let's fix the generated pages.

### Question pages {#question-pages}

[//]:
  #
  "Remove the following section once `generate` uses actual model attributes"

Jump over to `app/pages/questions/index.tsx`. Notice that a
`QuestionsList` component has been generated for you:

```tsx
// app/pages/questions/index.tsx

export const QuestionsList = () => {
  const router = useRouter()
  const page = Number(router.query.page) || 0
  const [{questions, hasMore}] = usePaginatedQuery(getQuestions, {
    orderBy: {id: "asc"},
    skip: ITEMS_PER_PAGE * page,
    take: ITEMS_PER_PAGE,
  })

  const goToPreviousPage = () => router.push({query: {page: page - 1}})
  const goToNextPage = () => router.push({query: {page: page + 1}})

  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {questions.map((question) => (
          <li key={question.id}>
            <Link href={`/questions/${question.id}`}>
              <a>{question.name}</a>
            </Link>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>

      <button disabled={page === 0} onClick={goToPreviousPage}>
        Previous
      </button>
      <button disabled={!hasMore} onClick={goToNextPage}>
        Next
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

This won’t work though! Remember that the `Question` model we created
above doesn’t have any `name` field. To fix this, replace `question.name`
with `question.text`:

```diff
// app/pages/questions/index.tsx

export const QuestionsList = () => {
  const router = useRouter()
  const page = Number(router.query.page) || 0
  const [{questions, hasMore}] = usePaginatedQuery(getQuestions, {
    orderBy: {id: "asc"},
    skip: ITEMS_PER_PAGE * page,
    take: ITEMS_PER_PAGE,
  })

  const goToPreviousPage = () => router.push({query: {page: page - 1}})
  const goToNextPage = () => router.push({query: {page: page + 1}})

  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {questions.map((question) => (
          <li key={question.id}>
            <Link href={`/questions/${question.id}`}>
-              <a>{question.name}</a>
+              <a>{question.text}</a>
            </Link>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>

      <button disabled={page === 0} onClick={goToPreviousPage}>
        Previous
      </button>
      <button disabled={!hasMore} onClick={goToNextPage}>
        Next
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Next, let’s apply a similar fix to
`app/questions/components/QuestionForm.tsx`. In the form submission,
replace the `LabeledTextField` `name` to be `"text"`

```diff
export function QuestionForm<S extends z.ZodType<any, any>>(
  props: FormProps<S>,
) {
  return (
    <Form<S> {...props}>
-     <LabeledTextField name="name" label="Name" placeholder="Name" />
+     <LabeledTextField name="text" label="Text" placeholder="Text" />
    </Form>
  )
}
```

### `createQuestion` mutation {#create-question-mutation}

In `app/questions/mutations/createQuestion.ts`, we need to update the
`CreateQuestion` zod validation schema to use `text` instead of `name`.

```diff
// app/questions/mutations/createQuestion.ts

const CreateQuestion = z
  .object({
-   name: z.string(),
+   text: z.string(),
  })
  .nonstrict()
// ...
```

### `updateQuestion` mutation {#update-question-mutation}

In `app/questions/mutations/updateQuestion.ts`, we need to update the
`UpdateQuestion` zod validation schema to use `text` instead of `name`.

```diff
// app/questions/mutations/updateQuestion.ts

const UpdateQuestion = z
  .object({
    id: z.number(),
-   name: z.string(),
+   text: z.string(),
  })
  .nonstrict()
// ...
```

### `deleteQuestion` mutation {#delete-question-mutation}

[//]: # "Remove this section once Prisma supports cascading deletes"

Prisma does not yet support "cascading deletes". In the context of this
tutorial, that means it does not currently delete the `Choice` data when
deleting a `Question`. We need to temporarily augment the generated
`deleteQuestion` mutation in order to do this manually. Open up
`app/questions/mutations/deleteQuestion.ts` in your text editor and add
the following to the top of the function body:

```ts
await db.choice.deleteMany({where: {questionId: id}})
```

The end result should be as such:

```diff
// app/questions/mutations/deleteQuestion.ts

export default resolver.pipe(
  resolver.zod(DeleteQuestion),
  resolver.authorize(),
  async ({id}) => {
+   await db.choice.deleteMany({where: {questionId: id}})
    const question = await db.question.deleteMany({where: {id}})

    return question
  },
)
```

This mutation will now delete the choices associated with the question
prior to deleting the question itself.

#### Now try creating, updating, and deleting questions

Great! Now make sure your app is running. If it isn’t, run `blitz dev` in
your terminal, and visit `localhost:3000/questions`. Try creating
questions, editing, and deleting them.

## Adding choices to the question form {#adding-choices-to-the-question-form}

You’re doing great so far! The next thing we’ll do is add choices to our
question form. Open `app/questions/components/QuestionForm.tsx` in your
editor.

Add three more `<LabeledTextField>` components as choices.

```diff
export function QuestionForm<S extends z.ZodType<any, any>>(
  props: FormProps<S>,
) {
  return (
    <Form<S> {...props}>
      <LabeledTextField name="text" label="Text" placeholder="Text" />
+     <LabeledTextField name="choices.0.text" label="Choice 1" />
+     <LabeledTextField name="choices.1.text" label="Choice 2" />
+     <LabeledTextField name="choices.2.text" label="Choice 3" />
    </Form>
  )
}
```

Next open `app/pages/questions/new.tsx` and set `initialValues` to be as
follows:

```diff
      <QuestionForm
        submitText="Create Question"
-       // initialValues={{ }}
+       initialValues={{choices: []}}
        onSubmit={async (values) => {
          try {
            const question = await createQuestionMutation(values)
            router.push(`/questions/${question.id}`)
          } catch (error) {
            console.error(error)
            return {
              [FORM_ERROR]: error.toString(),
            }
          }
        }}
      />
```

Then open `app/questions/mutations/createQuestion.ts` and update the zod
schema so that the choice data is accepted in the mutation. And we also
need to update the `db.question.create` call so that the choices will also
be created.

```diff
// app/questions/mutations/createQuestion.ts

const CreateQuestion = z
  .object({
    text: z.string(),
+   choices: z.array(z.object({text: z.string()})),
  })
  .nonstrict()

export default resolver.pipe(
  resolver.zod(CreateQuestion),
  resolver.authorize(),
  async (input) => {
-   const question = await db.question.create({data: input})
+   const question = await db.question.create({
+     data: {
+       ...input,
+       choices: {create: input.choices},
+     },
+   })

    return question
  },
)
```

#### Try it out

Now you can go to `localhost:3000/questions/new` and create a new question
with choices!

## Listing choices {#listing-choices}

Time for a breather. Go back to `localhost:3000/questions` in your browser
and look at all the questions you‘ve created. How about we list these
questions’ choices here too? First, we need to customize the question
queries. In Prisma, you need to manually let the client know that you want
to query for nested relations. Change your `getQuestion.ts` and
`getQuestions.ts` files to look like this:

```diff
// app/questions/queries/getQuestion.ts

const GetQuestion = z.object({
  // This accepts type of undefined, but is required at runtime
  id: z.number().optional().refine(Boolean, "Required"),
})

export default resolver.pipe(
  resolver.zod(GetQuestion),
  resolver.authorize(),
  async ({id}) => {
-   const question = await db.question.findFirst({where: {id}})
+   const question = await db.question.findFirst({
+     where: {id},
+     include: {choices: true},
+   })

    if (!question) throw new NotFoundError()

    return question
  },
)
```

```diff
// app/questions/queries/getQuestions.ts

interface GetQuestionsInput
  extends Pick<
    Prisma.QuestionFindManyArgs,
    "where" | "orderBy" | "skip" | "take"
  > {}

export default resolver.pipe(
  resolver.authorize(),
  async ({where, orderBy, skip = 0, take = 100}: GetQuestionsInput) => {
    const {items: questions, hasMore, nextPage, count} = await paginate({
      skip,
      take,
      count: () => db.question.count({where}),
      query: (paginateArgs) =>
        db.question.findMany({
          ...paginateArgs,
          where,
          orderBy,
+         include: {choices: true},
        }),
    })

    return {
      questions,
      nextPage,
      hasMore,
      count,
    }
  },
)
```

Now hop back to our main questions page
(`app/pages/questions/index.tsx`)in your editor, and we can list the
choices of each question. And add this code beneath the `Link` in our
`QuestionsList`:

```diff
// app/pages/questions/index.tsx

// ...
{
  questions.map((question) => (
    <li key={question.id}>
      <Link href={`/questions/${question.id}`}>
        <a>{question.text}</a>
      </Link>
+     <ul>
+       {question.choices.map((choice) => (
+         <li key={choice.id}>
+           {choice.text} - {choice.votes} votes
+         </li>
+       ))}
+     </ul>
    </li>
  ))
}
// ...
```

Now check `/questions` in the browser. **Magic!**

## Let’s let people vote on these questions! {#let-people-vote-on-questions}

Open `app/pages/questions/[questionId].tsx` in your editor. First, we’re
going to improve this page somewhat.

1. Replace `<h1>Question {question.id}</h1>` with
   `<h1>{question.text}</h1>`.

2. Delete the `pre` element, and copy in our choices list which we wrote
   before:

```tsx
<ul>
  {question.choices.map((choice) => (
    <li key={choice.id}>
      {choice.text} - {choice.votes} votes
    </li>
  ))}
</ul>
```

If you go back to your browser, your page should now look something like
this!

<img
  width="567"
  alt="Screenshot"
  src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24858006/80387990-3c3d8b80-88a1-11ea-956a-5be85f1e8f12.png"
/>

#### Now it’s time to add voting!

First we need to open `app/choices/mutations/updateChoice.ts`, update the
zod schema, and add add a vote increment.

```diff
const UpdateChoice = z
  .object({
    id: z.number(),
-   name: z.string(),
  })
  .nonstrict()

export default resolver.pipe(
  resolver.zod(UpdateChoice),
  resolver.authorize(),
  async ({id, ...data}) => {
-   const choice = await db.choice.update({where: {id}, data})
+   const choice = await db.choice.update({
+     where: {id},
+     data: {votes: {increment: 1}},
+   })

    return choice
  },
)
```

Now go back to `app/pages/questions/[questionId].tsx` and make the
following changes:

In our `li`, add a `button` like so:

```tsx
<li key={choice.id}>
  {choice.text} - {choice.votes} votes
  <button>Vote</button>
</li>
```

Then, import the `updateChoice` mutation we updated and create a
`handleVote` function in our page:

```diff
// app/pages/questions/[questionId].tsx
+import updateChoice from "app/choices/mutations/updateChoice"

//...

export const Question = () => {
  const router = useRouter()
  const questionId = useParam("questionId", "number")
  const [deleteQuestionMutation] = useMutation(deleteQuestion)
  const [question] = useQuery(getQuestion, {id: questionId})
+ const [updateChoiceMutation] = useMutation(updateChoice)
+
+ const handleVote = async (id: number) => {
+   try {
+     await updateChoiceMutation({id})
+     refetch()
+   } catch (error) {
+     alert("Error updating choice " + JSON.stringify(error, null, 2))
+   }
+ }

  return (
```

And then we need to update the question `useQuery` call to return the
`refetch` function which we use inside `handleVote`:

```diff
// app/pages/questions/[questionId].tsx

//...
- const [question] = useQuery(getQuestion, {id: questionId})
+ const [question, {refetch}] = useQuery(getQuestion, {id: questionId})
//...
```

Finally, we’ll tell our new `button` to call that function!

```tsx
<button onClick={() => handleVote(choice.id)}>Vote</button>
```

The final `Question` component should now look like this:

```tsx
export const Question = () => {
  const router = useRouter()
  const questionId = useParam("questionId", "number")
  const [deleteQuestionMutation] = useMutation(deleteQuestion)
  const [question, {refetch}] = useQuery(getQuestion, {id: questionId})
  const [updateChoiceMutation] = useMutation(updateChoice)

  const handleVote = async (id: number) => {
    try {
      await updateChoiceMutation({id})
      refetch()
    } catch (error) {
      alert("Error updating choice " + JSON.stringify(error, null, 2))
    }
  }

  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <title>Question {question.id}</title>
      </Head>

      <div>
        <h1>{question.text}</h1>
        <ul>
          {question.choices.map((choice) => (
            <li key={choice.id}>
              {choice.text} - {choice.votes} votes
              <button onClick={() => handleVote(choice.id)}>Vote</button>
            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>

        <Link href={`/questions/${question.id}/edit`}>
          <a>Edit</a>
        </Link>

        <button
          type="button"
          onClick={async () => {
            if (window.confirm("This will be deleted")) {
              await deleteQuestionMutation({id: question.id})
              router.push("/questions")
            }
          }}
          style={{marginLeft: "0.5rem"}}
        >
          Delete
        </button>
      </div>
    </>
  )
}
```

## Lastly, let's allow editing choices for an existing question {#edit-choices-for-question}

If you click the **Edit** button on one of your existing questions, you'll
see it uses the same form as creating questions. So that part is already
done! We only need to update our mutation.

Open `app/questions/mutations/updateQuestion.ts` and make the following
changes:

```diff
// app/questions/mutations/updateQuestion.ts
import {resolver} from "blitz"
import db from "db"
import * as z from "zod"

const UpdateQuestion = z
  .object({
    id: z.number(),
    text: z.string(),
+   choices: z.array(
+     z.object({id: z.number().optional(), text: z.string()}).nonstrict(),
+   ),
  })
  .nonstrict()

export default resolver.pipe(
  resolver.zod(UpdateQuestion),
  resolver.authorize(),
  async ({id, ...data}) => {
-   const question = await db.question.update({where: {id}, data})
+   const question = await db.question.update({
+     where: {id},
+     data: {
+       ...data,
+       choices: {
+         upsert: data.choices.map((choice) => ({
+           // Appears to be a prisma bug,
+           // because `|| 0` shouldn't be needed
+           where: {id: choice.id || 0},
+           create: {text: choice.text},
+           update: {text: choice.text},
+         })),
+       },
+     },
+   })

    return question
  },
)
```

[`upsert`](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#upsert)
is a special operation that means, "If this item exists, update it. Else
create it". This is perfect for this case because we didn't require the
user to add three choices when creating the question. So if later the user
adds another choice by editing the question, then it'll be created here.

## Conclusion {#conclusion}

🥳 Congrats! You created your very own Blitz app! Have fun playing around
with it, or sharing it with your friends. Now that you’ve finished this
tutorial, why not try making your voting app even better? You could try:

- Adding styling (Hint, try `blitz install tailwind` or
  `blitz install chakra-ui`)
- Showing some more statistics about votes
- Deploying live on [Render](./deploy-render) or [Vercel](./deploy-vercel)

If you want to share your project with the world wide Blitz community
there is no better place to do that than on Discord.

Visit [discord.blitzjs.com](https://discord.blitzjs.com). Then, post the
