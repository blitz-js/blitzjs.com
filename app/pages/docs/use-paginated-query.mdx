Use `usePaginatedQuery` instead of `useQuery`, if you want to divide large
data into smaller contiguous intervals of data. For instance, you have
many numbered pages, and you want to show the first three pages initially.
After clicking on `Show next pages`, the user should see the following
three pages only. For this case, you can `usePaginatedQuery` as shown in
the following example.

### Example {#example}

```ts
import { Suspense } from "react"
import {
  Link,
  BlitzPage,
  usePaginatedQuery,
  useRouterQuery,
  useRouter,
  Routes,
} from "blitz"
import getProjects from "app/products/queries/getProjects"

const ITEMS_PER_PAGE = 3

const Projects = () => {
  const router = useRouter()
  const page = Number(router.query.page) || 0
  const [{ projects, hasMore }] = usePaginatedQuery(getProjects, {
    orderBy: { id: "asc" },
    skip: ITEMS_PER_PAGE * page,
    take: ITEMS_PER_PAGE,
  })

  const goToPreviousPage = () =>
    router.push({ query: { page: page - 1 } })
  const goToNextPage = () => router.push({ query: { page: page + 1 } })

  return (
    <div>
      {projects.map((project) => (
        <p key={project.id}>
          <Link href={Routes.Project({ handle: project.handle })}>
            <a>{project.name}</a>
          </Link>
        </p>
      ))}
      <button disabled={page === 0} onClick={goToPreviousPage}>
        Previous
      </button>
      <button disabled={!hasMore} onClick={goToNextPage}>
        Next
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

And here's the query to work with that:

```ts
import { paginate, resolver } from "blitz"
import db, { Prisma } from "db"

interface GetProjectsInput
  extends Pick<
    Prisma.ProjectFindManyArgs,
    "where" | "orderBy" | "skip" | "take"
  > {}

export default resolver.pipe(
  resolver.authorize(),
  async ({ where, orderBy, skip = 0, take = 100 }: GetProjectsInput) => {
    const { items: projects, hasMore, nextPage, count } = await paginate({
      skip,
      take,
      count: () => db.project.count({ where }),
      query: (paginateArgs) =>
        db.project.findMany({ ...paginateArgs, where, orderBy }),
    })

    return {
      projects,
      nextPage,
      hasMore,
      count,
    }
  }
)
```

## API {#api}

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
const [
  queryResult,
  {
    dataUpdatedAt,
    error,
    errorUpdatedAt,
    failureCount,
    isError,
    isFetched,
    isFetchedAfterMount,
    isFetching,
    isIdle,
    isLoading,
    isLoadingError,
    isPlaceholderData,
    isPreviousData,
    isRefetchError,
    isStale,
    isSuccess,
    refetch,
    remove,
    status,
    setQueryData,
  }
] = usePaginatedQuery(queryResolver, queryInputArguments, options)
```

### Arguments {#arguments}

- `queryResolver:` A [Blitz query resolver](./query-resolvers)
  - **Required**
- `queryInputArguments`
  - **Required**
  - The arguments that will be passed to `queryResolver`
- `options`
  - Optional

### Options {#options}

The options are identical to the options for the
[useQuery hook](./use-query)

### Returns {#returns}

`[queryResult, queryExtras]`

##### `queryResult: TData`

- Defaults to `undefined`.
- The last successfully resolved data for the query.

##### `queryExtras: Object`

- `status: String`
  - Will be:
    - `idle` if the query is idle. This only happens if a query is
      initialized with `enabled: false` and no initial data is available.
    - `loading` if the query is in a "hard" loading state. This means
      there is no cached data and the query is currently fetching, eg
      `isFetching === true`
    - `error` if the query attempt resulted in an error. The corresponding
      `error` property has the error received from the attempted fetch
    - `success` if the query has received a response with no errors and is
      ready to display its data. The corresponding `data` property on the
      query is the data received from the successful fetch or if the
      query's `enabled` property is set to `false` and has not been
      fetched yet `data` is the first `initialData` supplied to the query
      on initialization.
- `isIdle: boolean`
  - A derived boolean from the `status` variable above, provided for
    convenience.
- `isLoading: boolean`
  - A derived boolean from the `status` variable above, provided for
    convenience.
- `isSuccess: boolean`
  - A derived boolean from the `status` variable above, provided for
    convenience.
- `isError: boolean`
  - A derived boolean from the `status` variable above, provided for
    convenience.
- `isLoadingError: boolean`
  - Will be `true` if the query failed while fetching for the first time.
- `isRefetchError: boolean`
  - Will be `true` if the query failed while refetching.
- `data: TData`
  - Defaults to `undefined`.
  - The last successfully resolved data for the query.
- `dataUpdatedAt: number`
  - The timestamp for when the query most recently returned the `status`
    as `"success"`.
- `error: null | TError`
  - Defaults to `null`
  - The error object for the query, if an error was thrown.
- `errorUpdatedAt: number`
  - The timestamp for when the query most recently returned the `status`
    as `"error"`.
- `isStale: boolean`
  - Will be `true` if the data in the cache is invalidated or if the data
    is older than the given `staleTime`.
- `isPlaceholderData: boolean`
  - Will be `true` if the data shown is the placeholder data.
- `isPreviousData: boolean`
  - Will be `true` when data from the previous query is returned.
- `isFetched: boolean`
  - Will be `true` if the query has been fetched.
- `isFetchedAfterMount: boolean`
  - Will be `true` if the query has been fetched after the component
    mounted.
  - This property can be used to not show any previously cached data.
- `isFetching: boolean`
  - Defaults to `true` so long as `enabled` is set to `false`
  - Will be `true` if the query is currently fetching, including
    background fetching.
- `failureCount: number`
  - The failure count for the query.
  - Incremented every time the query fails.
  - Reset to `0` when the query succeeds.
- `refetch: (options: { throwOnError: boolean, cancelRefetch: boolean }) => Promise<UseQueryResult>`
  - A function to manually refetch the query.
  - If the query errors, the error will only be logged. If you want an
    error to be thrown, pass the `throwOnError: true` option
  - If `cancelRefetch` is `true`, then the current request will be
    cancelled before a new request is made
- `remove: () => void`
  - A function to remove the query from the cache.
- `setQueryData()` - `Function(newData, opts) => Promise<void>`
  - A function to manually update the cache for a query.
  - `newData` can be an object of new data or a function that receives the
    old data and returns the new data
  - This is often used to instantly update the cache after submitting a
    form
  - After updating the cache, this will automatically call `refetch()` to
    ensure the data is correct. Disable refetch by passing an options
    object `{refetch: false}` as the second argument.
  - See the [Blitz mutation usage docs](./mutation-usage#setQueryData) for
    example usage of `setQueryData()`.
