### Example {#example}

React Concurrent Mode is enabled by default for Blitz apps. So the
`<Suspense>` component is used for loading states and `<ErrorBoundary>` is
used to display errors. If you need, you can read the
[React Concurrent Mode Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-intro.html).

```tsx
import {Suspense} from "react"
import {useQuery, useRouter, useParam} from "blitz"
import getProject from "app/projects/queries/getProject"
import ErrorBoundary from "app/components/ErrorBoundary"

function Project() {
  const router = useRouter()
  const projectId = useParam("projectId", "number")
  const [project] = useQuery(getProject, {where: {id: projectId}})

  return <div>{project.name}</div>
}

function WrappedProject() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ErrorBoundary
        fallback={(error) => <div>Error: {JSON.stringify(error)}</div>}
      >
        <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
          <Project />
        </Suspense>
      </ErrorBoundary>
    </div>
  )
}

export default WrappedProject
```

### Arguments {#arguments}

- `queryResolver:` A [Blitz query resolver](./query-resolvers)
  - **Required**
- `queryInputArguments`
  - **Required**
  - The arguments that will be passed to `queryResolver`
- `options`
  - Optional

### Options {#options}

- `enabled: boolean`
  - Set this to `false` to disable this query from automatically running.
  - Can be used for [Dependent Queries](./query-usage#dependent-queries).
- `retry: boolean | number | (failureCount: number, error: TError) => boolean`
  - If `false`, failed queries will not retry by default.
  - If `true`, failed queries will retry infinitely.
  - If set to a `number`, e.g. `3`, failed queries will retry until the
    failed query count meets that number.
- `retryOnMount: boolean`
  - If set to `false`, the query will not be retried on mount if it
    contains an error. Defaults to `true`.
- `retryDelay: number | (retryAttempt: number, error: TError) => number`
  - This function receives a `retryAttempt` integer and the actual Error
    and returns the delay to apply before the next attempt in
    milliseconds.
  - A function like
    `attempt => Math.min(attempt > 1 ? 2 ** attempt * 1000 : 1000, 30 * 1000)`
    applies exponential backoff.
  - A function like `attempt => attempt * 1000` applies linear backoff.
- `staleTime: number | Infinity`
  - The time in milliseconds after data is considered stale. This value
    only applies to the hook it is defined on.
  - If set to `Infinity`, the data will never be considered stale
- `cacheTime: number | Infinity`
  - The time in milliseconds that unused/inactive cache data remains in
    memory. When a query's cache becomes unused or inactive, that cache
    data will be garbage collected after this duration. When different
    cache times are specified, the longest one will be used.
  - If set to `Infinity`, will disable garbage collection
- `refetchInterval: false | number`
  - Optional
  - If set to a number, all queries will continuously refetch at this
    frequency in milliseconds
- `refetchIntervalInBackground: boolean`
  - Optional
  - If set to `true`, queries that are set to continuously refetch with a
    `refetchInterval` will continue to refetch while their tab/window is
    in the background
- `refetchOnMount: boolean | "always"`
  - Optional
  - Defaults to `true`
  - If set to `true`, the query will refetch on mount if the data is
    stale.
  - If set to `false`, the query will not refetch on mount.
  - If set to `"always"`, the query will always refetch on mount.
- `refetchOnWindowFocus: boolean | "always"`
  - Optional
  - Defaults to `true`
  - If set to `true`, the query will refetch on window focus if the data
    is stale.
  - If set to `false`, the query will not refetch on window focus.
  - If set to `"always"`, the query will always refetch on window focus.
- `refetchOnReconnect: boolean | "always"`
  - Optional
  - Defaults to `true`
  - If set to `true`, the query will refetch on reconnect if the data is
    stale.
  - If set to `false`, the query will not refetch on reconnect.
  - If set to `"always"`, the query will always refetch on reconnect.
- `notifyOnChangeProps: string[] | "tracked"`
  - Optional
  - If set, the component will only re-render if any of the listed
    properties change.
  - If set to `['data', 'error']` for example, the component will only
    re-render when the `data` or `error` properties change.
  - If set to `"tracked"`, access to properties will be tracked, and the
    component will only re-render when one of the tracked properties
    change.
- `notifyOnChangePropsExclusions: string[]`
  - Optional
  - If set, the component will not re-render if any of the listed
    properties change.
  - If set to `['isStale']` for example, the component will not re-render
    when the `isStale` property changes.
- `onSuccess: (data: TData) => void`
  - Optional
  - This function will fire any time the query successfully fetches new
    data.
- `onError: (error: TError) => void`
  - Optional
  - This function will fire if the query encounters an error and will be
    passed the error.
- `onSettled: (data?: TData, error?: TError) => void`
  - Optional
  - This function will fire any time the query is either successfully
    fetched or errors and be passed either the data or error
- `select: (data: TData) => unknown`
  - Optional
  - This option can be used to transform or select a part of the data
    returned by the query function.
- `suspense: boolean`
  - Optional
  - Set this to `false` to disable suspense mode.
  - When `true`, `useQuery` will suspend when `status === 'loading'`
  - When `true`, `useQuery` will throw runtime errors when
    `status === 'error'`
- `initialData: TData | () => TData`
  - Optional
  - If set, this value will be used as the initial data for the query
    cache (as long as the query hasn't been created or cached yet)
  - If set to a function, the function will be called **once** during the
    shared/root query initialization, and be expected to synchronously
    return the initialData
  - Initial data is considered stale by default unless a `staleTime` has
    been set.
  - `initialData` **is persisted** to the cache
- `initialDataUpdatedAt: number | (() => number | undefined)`
  - Optional
  - If set, this value will be used as the time (in milliseconds) of when
    the `initialData` itself was last updated.
- `placeholderData: TData | () => TData`
  - Optional
  - If set, this value will be used as the placeholder data for this
    particular query observer while the query is still in the `loading`
    data and no initialData has been provided.
  - `placeholderData` is **not persisted** to the cache
- `keepPreviousData: boolean`
  - Optional
  - Defaults to `false`
  - If set, any previous `data` will be kept when fetching new data
    because the query key changed.
- `structuralSharing: boolean`
  - Optional
  - Defaults to `true`

### Returns {#returns}

`[queryResult, queryExtras]`

##### `queryResult: TData`

- Defaults to `undefined`.
- The last successfully resolved data for the query.

##### `queryExtras: Object`

- `status: String`
  - Will be:
    - `idle` if the query is idle. This only happens if a query is
      initialized with `enabled: false` and no initial data is available.
    - `loading` if the query is in a "hard" loading state. This means
      there is no cached data and the query is currently fetching, eg
      `isFetching === true`
    - `error` if the query attempt resulted in an error. The corresponding
      `error` property has the error received from the attempted fetch
    - `success` if the query has received a response with no errors and is
      ready to display its data. The corresponding `data` property on the
      query is the data received from the successful fetch or if the
      query's `enabled` property is set to `false` and has not been
      fetched yet `data` is the first `initialData` supplied to the query
      on initialization.
- `isIdle: boolean`
  - A derived boolean from the `status` variable above, provided for
    convenience.
- `isLoading: boolean`
  - A derived boolean from the `status` variable above, provided for
    convenience.
- `isSuccess: boolean`
  - A derived boolean from the `status` variable above, provided for
    convenience.
- `isError: boolean`
  - A derived boolean from the `status` variable above, provided for
    convenience.
- `isLoadingError: boolean`
  - Will be `true` if the query failed while fetching for the first time.
- `isRefetchError: boolean`
  - Will be `true` if the query failed while refetching.
- `data: TData`
  - Defaults to `undefined`.
  - The last successfully resolved data for the query.
- `dataUpdatedAt: number`
  - The timestamp for when the query most recently returned the `status`
    as `"success"`.
- `error: null | TError`
  - Defaults to `null`
  - The error object for the query, if an error was thrown.
- `errorUpdatedAt: number`
  - The timestamp for when the query most recently returned the `status`
    as `"error"`.
- `isStale: boolean`
  - Will be `true` if the data in the cache is invalidated or if the data
    is older than the given `staleTime`.
- `isPlaceholderData: boolean`
  - Will be `true` if the data shown is the placeholder data.
- `isPreviousData: boolean`
  - Will be `true` when `keepPreviousData` is set and data from the
    previous query is returned.
- `isFetched: boolean`
  - Will be `true` if the query has been fetched.
- `isFetchedAfterMount: boolean`
  - Will be `true` if the query has been fetched after the component
    mounted.
  - This property can be used to not show any previously cached data.
- `isFetching: boolean`
  - Defaults to `true` so long as `enabled` is set to `false`
  - Will be `true` if the query is currently fetching, including
    background fetching.
- `failureCount: number`
  - The failure count for the query.
  - Incremented every time the query fails.
  - Reset to `0` when the query succeeds.
- `refetch: (options: { throwOnError: boolean, cancelRefetch: boolean }) => Promise<UseQueryResult>`
  - A function to manually refetch the query.
  - If the query errors, the error will only be logged. If you want an
    error to be thrown, pass the `throwOnError: true` option
  - If `cancelRefetch` is `true`, then the current request will be
    cancelled before a new request is made
- `remove: () => void`
  - A function to remove the query from the cache.
- `setQueryData()` - `Function(newData, opts) => Promise<void>`
  - A function to manually update the cache for a query.
  - `newData` can be an object of new data or a function that receives the
    old data and returns the new data
  - This is often used to instantly update the cache after submitting a
    form
  - After updating the cache, this will automatically call `refetch()` to
    ensure the data is correct. Disable refetch by passing an options
    object `{refetch: false}` as the second argument.
  - See the [Blitz mutation usage docs](./mutation-usage#setQueryData) for
    example usage of `setQueryData()`.
