title: Custom Webpack Config
sidebar_label: Webpack Config

In order to extend our usage of `webpack`, you can define a function that
extends its config inside `blitz.config.js`, like so:

```js
module.exports = {
  webpack: (
    config,
    { buildId, dev, isServer, defaultLoaders, webpack }
  ) => {
    // Note: we provide webpack above so you should not `require` it
    // Perform customizations to webpack config
    // Important: return the modified config
    config.plugins.push(new webpack.IgnorePlugin(/\/__tests__\//))
    return config
  },
  webpackDevMiddleware: (config) => {
    // Perform customizations to webpack dev middleware config
    // Important: return the modified config
    return config
  },
}
```

Some commonly asked for features are available as plugins:

- [@next/mdx](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/next-mdx)
- [@next/bundle-analyzer](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/next-bundle-analyzer)
- [@zeit/next-preact](https://github.com/zeit/next-plugins/tree/master/packages/next-preact)

> The `webpack` function is executed twice, once for the server and once
> for the client. This allows you to distinguish between client and server
> configuration using the `isServer` property.

The second argument to the `webpack` function is an object with the
following properties:

- `buildId`: `String` - The build id, used as a unique identifier between
  builds
- `dev`: `Boolean` - Indicates if the compilation will be done in
  development
- `isServer`: `Boolean` - It's `true` for server-side compilation, and
  `false` for client-side compilation
- `defaultLoaders`: `Object` - Default loaders used internally by Next.js:
  - `babel`: `Object` - Default `babel-loader` configuration

Example usage of `defaultLoaders.babel`:

```js
// Example config for adding a loader that depends on babel-loader
// This source was taken from the @next/mdx plugin source:
// https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/next-mdx
module.exports = {
  webpack: (config, options) => {
    config.module.rules.push({
      test: /\.mdx/,
      use: [
        options.defaultLoaders.babel,
        {
          loader: "@mdx-js/loader",
          options: pluginOptions.options,
        },
      ],
    })

    return config
  },
}
```
