The incredible power of Blitz Recipes isn't limited to the official
recipes in the Blitz repo. The API for building recipes is a public API
(although one that is subject to change) exposed via the
[`@blitzjs/installer`](https://npm.im/@blitzjs/installer) package, which
can be installed into your own scripts to write a completely custom
recipe. Combined with the power of
[`jscodeshift`](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift) for transforming
existing files, fully automated code migrations are first-class citizens
in the Blitz ecosystem. In fact, in the future we hope that upgrading
Blitz will actually be possible with a quick `blitz install blitz@1.0.0`.

### Setup {#setup}

To author your own recipe, you'll want to create a new package and install
a couple of dependencies. You'll only need the `jscodeshift` dependencies
if you're using a **transform** step to modify an existing file. If you're
only creating new files or adding dependencies you'll only need
`@blitzjs/installer`.

If you're going to be writing tests for your recipe you'll need a build
and test setup. We recommend [`tsdx`](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/tsdx)
and Jest for building and running tests.

```bash
yarn add -EL @blitzjs/installer jscodeshift @types/jscodeshift
```

The Recipe API all revolves around the `RecipeBuilder` factory. Blitz
assumes that the file referenced in the `main` field of your
`package.json` has a recipe as its default export, so we can go ahead and
set that up.

```json
// package.json
{
  "main": "index.ts"
}
```

```typescript
// index.ts
import {RecipeBuilder} from "@blitzjs/installer"

export default RecipeBuilder().build()
```

### Adding Metadata {#adding-metadata}

In addition to the actual steps of the recipe, we require that the
developer supply metadata about the recipe. This allows us to display some
information to the user about what they're installing, as well as where
they can look for support if they need it.

```typescript
RecipeBuilder()
  .setName("My Package")
  .setDescription(
    "A little bit of information about what exactly is being installed.",
  )
  .setOwner("Fake Author <blitz@blitzjs.com>")
  .setRepoLink("https://github.com/fake-author/my-recipe")
  .build()
```

This is a pretty good start, and is actually all we need to create an
executable recipe that a user can run via `blitz install`. However, it's
not very useful because we don't actually have any steps for the installer
framework to execute. Keep reading to learn about the different actions we
can execute.

### Common API {#common-api}

Each action type has a shared interface for defining a "step" in the
recipe. This ensures consistency in the user experience and enables us to
provide a pleasant installation experience. Each step that gets added must
have a string ID that's used to internally track the progress of the
installation, a display name, and an explanation for what the step is
doing.

```typescript
interface Config {
  stepId: string
  stepName: string
  explanation: string
}
```

Eventually we expect to provide hooks into the recipe lifecycle, making
some of the metadata like `stepId` critical.

### Adding Dependencies {#adding-dependencies}

The first action we can take is adding dependencies to the user's
application. This step type will automatically detect whether the user is
using `yarn` or `npm` and use the proper tool. The configuration is very
straightforward â€” it accepts a list of packages, their versions, and
whether or not they should be installed as a `devDependency`.

```typescript
builder.addAddDependenciesStep({
  stepId: "addDeps",
  stepName: "Add npm dependencies",
  explanation: `We'll install the Tailwind library itself, as well as PostCSS for removing unused styles from our production bundles.`,
  packages: [
    {name: "tailwindcss", version: "1"},
    {name: "postcss-preset-env", version: "latest", isDevDep: true},
  ],
})
```

### Adding files {#adding-files}

One incredibly powerful part of recipes is the ability to generate files
from templates.

We use a custom templating language that's natural to both read and write.
[Read our template documentation to learn how to write templates](templates).

By supplying the `templateValues` configuration, you can either supply a
hard-coded object for values to interpolate in the template or a function
that returns an object. The function will be passed any additional
arguments passed to `blitz install` (e.g.
`blitz install myrecipe --someConfig=false`). The template files can go
anywhere in your recipe's file structure, you supply the path as a part of
the recipe definition.

```typescript
import {join} from "path"

builder.addNewFilesStep({
  stepId: "addStyles",
  stepName: "Add base Tailwind CSS styles",
  explanation: `Next, we need to actually create some stylesheets! These stylesheets can either be modified to include global styles for your app, or you can stick to using classnames in your components.`,
  targetDirectory: "./app",
  templatePath: join(__dirname, "templates", "styles"),
  templateValues: {},
})
```

### Modifying existing files {#modifying-existing-files}

Arguably the most powerful part of Blitz recipes, using JSCodeShift you
can write a transform that will modify an existing file. The transform
function is passed the AST representing the selected file, an object for
building new nodes, and an object to assist with typechecking and
assertions on nodes. [ASTExplorer](https://astexplorer.net) is a great
place to get familiar with the AST structures and to play around with
transforms. For best results, use the `@babel/parser` for the parser
setting, and `jscodeshift` for the transform setting.

Blitz supplies some predefined transforms for you for the most common
cases, but you can always write a custom transform to modify any
JavaScript file you want. We also provide a convenience utility for
accessing common files like `_app.tsx` or `blitz.config.js`. If the file
path is a glob pattern, the installer process will prompt the user to
select a file matching the pattern.

```typescript
import {addImport, paths} from "@blitzjs/installer"
import j from "jscodeshift"
import Collection from "jscodeshift/src/Collection"

builder.addTransformFilesStep({
  stepId: "importStyles",
  stepName: "Import stylesheets",
  explanation: `Finaly, we can import the stylesheets we created, into our application. For now we'll put them in document.tsx, but if you'd like to only style a part of your app with tailwind you could import the styles lower down in your component tree.`,
  singleFileSearch: paths.app(),
  transform(program: Collection<j.Program>) {
    const stylesImport = j.importDeclaration(
      [],
      j.literal("app/styles/index.css"),
    )
    return addImport(program, stylesImport)!
  },
})
```

Because transforms are self-contained functions that execute on ASTs, you
can actually unit test this part of your installer, which is incredibly
helpful for reliability. Using `jscodeshift` directly along with snapshot
testing, the tests are quick to write:

```typescript
import j from "jscodeshift"

const sampleFile = `export default function Comp() {
  return <div>hello!</div>;
})`
expect(addImport(j(sampleFile), newImport).toSource()).toMatchSnapshot()
```

#### Modifying Non-JS files

Not all modifications can be performed using `jscodeshift`. For any other
transformations, you can use `transformPlain`:

```ts
builder
  .addTransformFilesStep({
     ...,
     singleFileSearch: "README.md",
     transformPlain(readme: string) {
       return readme + "\n" + "Paul Plain was here!"
     },
   })
```

This step would append "Paul Plain was here!" to the user's README.md

### Publishing {#publishing}

That's all you need to build a recipe! At this point, you can commit and
push up to GitHub, and your recipe is available to the world. Users can
install your recipe by passing your full repository name to
`blitz install` - for example:

```bash
blitz install some-githubuser/my-awesome-recipe
```

### Testing locally {#testing-locally}

To test your recipe locally without publishing it you can run

```bash
blitz install /path/to/your/recipes/index.ts
```
