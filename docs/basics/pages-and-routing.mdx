Blitz.js pages work the same as Next.js pages. If you need, read [the Next.js Page documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages)

- Unlike Next.js, you can have many `pages/` folders nested inside `app/`. This way pages can be organized neatly, especially for larger projects. Like this:
  - `app/pages/about.tsx`
  - `app/projects/pages/projects/index.tsx`
  - `app/tasks/pages/projects/[projectId]/tasks/[id].tsx`
- All React components inside a `pages/` folder are accessible at a URL corresponding to it's path inside `pages/`. So `pages/about.tsx` will be at `localhost:3000/about`.

The Next.js router APIs are all exported from the `blitz` package: `useRouter()`, `withRouter()`, and `Router`. If you need, read [the Next.js Router documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/router).
