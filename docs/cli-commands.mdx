The Blitz CLI contains a comprehensive set of commands to interact with all components of your Blitz app. It also provides convenient access to developer tooling supplied by other frameworks, such as Prisma Studio.

## Core commands

### `blitz help`

Displays all of the CLI's information in the console. Additionally, all core commands support a `--help` flag which will print the information in this document to the console. It's omitted from all "Options" tables below for brevity.

### `blitz new`

Generates a new Blitz project in the current directory. The project will include basic scaffolding for a landing page, a database, and all of the other configuration that makes Blitz's magic work.

#### Arguments

```bash
blitz new [name]
```

| Argument | Required | Description                                                   |
| -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`   | ☑️       | The project name. Will be used in initial project scaffolding |

#### Options

| Argument    | Shorthand | Description                                                                                                     | Default |
| ----------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `--dry-run` | `-d`      | Displays what files would be generated but does not write the files to disk.                                    | `false` |
| `--js`      |           | Generates a JavaScript-only project. If omitted, a TypeScript project will be generated by default.             | `false` |
| `--npm`     |           | Uses `npm` as the project's package manager. If omitted, the project will default to `yarn` if it is installed. | `false` |

#### Examples

```bash
blitz new task-manager
```

```bash
blitz new task-manager --npm
```

### `blitz start`

**Alias: `blitz s`**

Start a server running your Blitz app on the current device. Primarily used for local development, but can also be used in production mode to deploy your app to a traditional server.

#### Arguments

None

#### Options

| Option         | Shorthand | Description                                                                                                            | Default       |
| -------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `--hostname`   | `-H`      | Set the hostname to use for the server.                                                                                | `"localhost"` |
| `--port`       | `-p`      | Set the port you'd like the server to listen on.                                                                       | `3000`        |
| `--production` | ️         | Start the server in production mode. This will enable features like minification for optimized production performance. | `false`       |

#### Examples

```bash
blitz start
```

```bash
blitz start --production
```

```bash
blitz start --production -H 127.0.0.1 -p 5632
```

### `blitz build`

**Alias: `blitz b`**

Create a production build of your Bltiz app. The build output will be a valid Next.js app and can be deployed the same way a plain Next app can be deployed.

#### Options

| Option       | Shorthand | Description                                      | Default       |
| ------------ | --------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------- |

| `--port`     | `-p`      | Set the port you'd like the server to listen on. | `3000`        |

#### Examples

```bash
blitz build
```

```bash
blitz build -H 127.0.0.1 -p 5632
```

### `blitz console`

**Alias: `blitz c`**

One of the easiest ways to test that your data models, queries, and mutations are working properly. The Blitz console connects to the database in your `.env` file, loads in your application code, and enables you to quickly prototype while interacting with your actual database. You'll be able to query, write rows, and prototype complex mutations all at the command line, without having to update your UI.

#### Examples

```bash
blitz console
```

### `blitz generate`

**Alias: `blitz g`**

As your application grows, Blitz helps reduce boilerplate and increase developer efficiency by generating code for you. However, many code generation tools try to generate too much code and be too smart, potentially interfering with your productivity. The Blitz generator aims to provide a balance between strong opinions that will help your app scale, reduce handwritten boilerplate, and producing the minimal amount of code so you can start building instead of spending time deleting templated code you don't need.

The generator can currently generate pages, queries, and mutations. Generating `Prisma` models is coming soon. Also coming soon is support for custom templates based on the built-in templates so you can customize the generator to your app's needs.

#### Arguments

```bash
blitz generate [type] [model]
```

| Argument | Required | Description                                                                                                                                          |
| -------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type`   | ☑️       | Specifies the type of files to generate. Options: `all`, `crud` (queries and mutations), `queries`, `mutations`, and `pages`.                        |
| `model`  | ☑️       | The name of the model that backs the generated files. This name will also appear in the generated folder structure to assist with code organization. |

#### Options

| Option      | Shorthand | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Default |
| ----------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| `--context` | `-c`      | Provide a context folder where the generated files should be placed. This will **not** affect generated file contents or Next routes, only logical organization in the file system. The context can also be supplied in the name of the model itself using a file path separator, e.g. `blitz generate all projects/tasks`. Blitz does not limit the depth of context paths, although deeply nested paths may be difficult to navigate.                                        | None    |
| `--dry-run` | `-d`      | Displays what files would be generated but does not write the files to disk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | `false` |
| `--parent`  | `-p`      | Specifies that the data model used for page generation has a child relationship with another data model. This will nest the generated pages under routes for the parent model, all generated query usages will filter by the parent model's ID, and all generated mutations will auto-create associations with the parent. Links are also updated to be relative links within the context of the parent model. This flag has no effect when generating files other than pages. |         |

#### Examples

The simplest use of the generator is to generate all pages, queries, and mutations based on a model in your schema:

```bash
blitz generate all projects
```

Alternatively, you can specify only a single resource type:

```bash
blitz generate mutations projects
```

As your project grows you may need to nest folders to create logical groups of files, especially if you're following Blitz's philosophy that files which change together should be colocated. Blitz makes that easier with the `context` option:

```bash
blitz generate all projects/tasks
# Could also supply `--context=projects`
# Generated files placed in app/projects/tasks/*
```

In addition to logical organization, your data model will likely have dependent models. In this case, we can use the `parent` option to tell Blitz to generate files that know about their parent model:

```bash
blitz generate pages tasks --parent=projects
# Generated files placed in app/projects/pages/projects/[projectId]/tasks
```

The above will generate code that knows about your models' relationships! For example, `index.tsx` will contain code like this:

```jsx
const TasksList = () => {
  const router = useRouter()
  const projectId = parseInt(router?.query.projectId as string)
  const [tasks] = useQuery(getTasks, {where: {Project: {id: projectId}}})

  return (
    <ul>
      {tasks.map((task) => (
        <li key={task.id}>
          <Link
            href="/projects/[projectId]/tasks/[id]"
            as={`/projects/${projectId}/tasks/${task.id}`}
          >
            <a>{task.name}</a>
          </Link>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

## Interacting with your database

Part of Blitz's magic is interacting directly with your database with strong TypeScript types, and Prisma provides this out of the box experience. Most `blitz db` commands are nothing more than proxies to Prisma behavior. Prisma's [very detailed docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/) are the source of truth here, and will be very useful for helping you get up and running with Blitz's built-in database infrastructure.

In the future, Blitz's plugin system will enable other database solutions to hook into some of this core functionality.

### `blitz db migrate`

As detailed in the [Prisma docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-migrate), this command reads your schema file (located at `db/schema.prisma`) and runs migrations to update tables and columns to match what's in your schema file. Lastly, it'll generate your Prisma Client code to enable you to have typesafe access to your database.
This command is marked as "experimental" in the Prisma docs so you may find some rough edges here.

### `blitz db introspect`

Sometimes you need to connect to an existing database and your Blitz app will be a new gateway to existing data. `blitz introspect` will query the database defined in your schema and automatically generate a complete `schema.prisma` file for you based on the tables and columns present. Lastly, it'll generate your Prisma Client code to enable you to have typesafe access to your database.

### `blitz db studio`

Often during development you need a quick peek into your database, or maybe you want to seed your database with sample data after running `blitz new` so you have sample data to work with. This command opens the Prisma Studio UI at [http://localhost:5555](http://localhost:5555) to see and change data in your database with a built-in GUI, rather than needing to download your own SQL client to connect to a remote server or a `sqlite` file.
