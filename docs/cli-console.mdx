**Alias: `blitz c`**

Starts a Node.js REPL with your [database](./database-overview.mdx) and all your [queries](./query-definition.mdx) and [mutations](./mutation-definition.mdx) preloaded.

This makes it very simple to read or write to your database and run one-off commands using your queries or mutations. It's also great for testing and rapid prototype exploration.

#### Examples

```bash
> blitz console

You have entered the Blitz console
Tips: - Exit by typing .exit or pressing Ctrl-D
      - Use your db like this: db.project.findMany().then(console.log)
      - Use your queries/mutations like this: getProjects().then(console.log)
      - Top level `await` support coming: https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/issues/230
