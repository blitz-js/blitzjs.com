The Blitz CLI is your single access point for interacting with your app, from database management to code generation. It is opinionated and will guide you towards best practices, while flexible enough to allow you to build your project however you'd like.

### Installation

You've likely already interacted with the Blitz CLI when setting up your app. We recommend installing Blitz globally to ensure that you can quickly run Blitz commands on-demand:

```bash
# Yarn
yarn global add blitz

# npm
npm i -g blitz
```

In the following sections you can learn about all of the CLI commands, as well as take a deep dive into more complex concepts like code generation. For now, we recommend you start with reading about [the CLI commands](./cli-commands). The examples in the following documentation will all revolve around an example task manager app to avoid contrived examples.
