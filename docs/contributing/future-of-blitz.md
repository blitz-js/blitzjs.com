Here's the list of big things that are currently missing from Blitz but are top priority for us:

- A real Blitzjs.com website and documentation
- Authentication
- Authorization (use auth rules both on server and client)
- Model validation (use model validation both on server and client)
- `blitz new` including set up for testing, Prettier, ESLint, styling system (Tailwind, CSS-in-JS, etc)
- React-Native support
- GUI for folks who prefer that over CLIs
- ... and tons more üôÇ
