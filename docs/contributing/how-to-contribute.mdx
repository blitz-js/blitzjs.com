We're so excited you're interested in helping with Blitz! We happy to help you get started, even if you don't have any previous open-source experience :)

### Blitz is a Community Project

Blitz is built by and for the community. There's no large company sponsoring development. So all community contributions are very appreciated!

### Our Codebase is a Garden

The Blitz codebase is like a community garden. There's a lot of beautiful plants and vegitables, but it won't take long until you find some weeds! When you find weeds, please remove them :) Minor refactoring is always encouraged. If you'd like to do some major refactoring, it's best to first either open an issue or check with us in Slack. Most likely we'll agree with you.

### First Things First

1. Familiarize yourself with the [Blitz Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md)
2. Join the [Blitz Slack Community](https://slack.blitzjs.com)
3. Install the [Zenhub browser extension](https://www.zenhub.com/extension)
4. View open issues and their progress [on the Zenhub repo tab](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz#zenhub)

### What to Work On?

Issues with the label [`ready to work on | help wanted`](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22ready+to+work+on+%7C+help+wanted%22) are the best place to start. If you find one that looks interesting and no one else is already working on it, comment in the issue that you are going to work on it. Please ask as many questions as you need, either directly in the issue or in Slack. We're happy to help!

The Blitzjs.com website and documentation repo also has issues with [`ready to work on | help wanted`](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitzjs.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22ready+to+work+on+%7C+help+wanted%22).

#### Things that are ALWAYS welcome

- Improved documentation
- Improved error messages
- Improved logging (i.e. more clear, more beautiful)
- Educational content like blogs, videos, courses

If there's some other way you'd like to contribute, ask us about it in slack!

After you contribute in any way, please add yourself as a contributor via the [@all-contributors bot](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/bot/usage)!
