Blitz.js custom API routes are exactly the same as Next.js custom API routes. If you need, read [the Next.js API route documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)

- Unlike Next.js, your `api/` folder must be a sibling of `pages/` instead of being nested inside.
- All files inside an `api/` folder are accessible at a URL corresponding to it's path inside `api/`. So `app/projects/api/webhook.ts` will be at `localhost:3000/api/webhook`.
