title: Deploy to a Managed Server on DigitalOcean App Platform
sidebar_label: To DigitalOcean
---

In this guide you are going to deploy a Blitz application to App Platform with `doctl` and the App Spec.
If you want to deploy your application with the App Platform UI make sure to use the right build and run commands
and do not forget to add the necessary environment variables. You can find them in this guide.

## Prerequisites

To follow this guide you will need:

- The [DigitalOcean CLI (doctl)](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/apis-clis/doctl/), version 1.5 or higher, installed and configured on your local computer.
- A GitHub repository for your application

## Creating the database

In this step you will set up a new managed PostgreSQL database with `doctl`.

Create a new database.

```bash
doctl db create <name> --region <region> --engine pg --version 12
```

> **Note**: For this guide we are creating a PostgreSQL database but MySQL is also available on DigitalOcean.

:::caution
App Platform currently only supports the following regions: **nyc1**, **nyc3**, **ams3**, or **fra1**.
:::

You also have to add a connection pool to the database.

> **Note**: You can read more about what a connection pool is and why it is useful at the [DigitalOcean docs](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/databases/postgresql/how-to/manage-connection-pools/).

First you need to get the `id` of the database.

```bash
doctl db list
```

Now you can create a connection pool for the database.

```bash
doctl db pool create <db-id> <pool-name> --db defaultdb --user doadmin --size 1
```

> **Note**: `defaultdb` and `doadmin` are the default database and user created by DigitalOcean. For more options you can check the [doctl databases docs](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/apis-clis/doctl/reference/databases/).

To use the newly created database with App Platform you have to add it to the App Spec. Create a folder called `.do` and add a file called `app.yaml`.

Add the configuration below to `app.yaml`. As you can see we are also adding a name and region for the deployment.

```yaml
name: <project-name>
region: <region>
databases:
  - cluster_name: <database-name>
    db_name: defaultdb
    db_user: doadmin
    engine: PG
    name: <database-name>
    production: true
    version: "12"
```

Replace `<project-name>` with the name of your App Platform project and`<region>` with one of the available regions. These are **nyc**, **ams** and **fra** (without number).
Add the name that you used to create the database for `<database-name>`.

:::caution
Make sure to use the same region as the database region.
:::

## Deploying the application

Now that you have created the database it is time to configure and deploy the application.

Add the configuration below to `app.yaml`.

```yaml
services:
  - build_command: npx blitz db migrate && npx blitz build
    environment_slug: node-js
    envs:
   - key: NODE_ENV
     value: production
     scope: RUN_AND_BUILD_TIME
    github:
      branch: main
      deploy_on_push: true
      repo: <repo-url>
    http_port: 3000
    instance_count: 1
    instance_size_slug: <instance-size>
    name: <app-name>
    routes:
      - path: /
    run_command: npx next start
```

Replace `<repo-url>` with the URL of your git repository and `<app-name>` with the name of your application.

For `<instance-size>` you can get a list of all the available instance sizes with the command below and use the `slug` value of the instance you want to use.

```bash
doctl apps tier instance-size list
```

> **Note**: To get an overview of all the available options you can check out the [App Specification docs](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/app-platform/references/app-specification-reference/).

You also have to add the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to connect the app to the database.

First you need to get the `id` of the database.

```bash
doctl db list
```

Now you can get the connection string of to the connection pool.

```bash
doctl db pool list <database-id>
```

Add `&pgbouncer=true` to the end of the connection string and add it to `app.yaml`.

```yaml
 ...
 services:
   envs:
      - key: DATABASE_URL
        value: <connection-string>
        scope: RUN_AND_BUILD_TIME
        type: SECRET
 ...

```

The `SESSION_SECRET_KEY` environment variable is also needed for encrypting cookies. This string has to be atleast 32 characters long.

```yaml
...
 services:
   envs:
      - key: SESSION_SECRET_KEY
        value: <session-secret-key>
        scope: RUN_TIME
        type: SECRET
 ...

```

Now you can deploy the application.

```bash
doctl apps create --spec app.yaml
```

The first time you have to use `doctl` to connect your repository with App Platform. After that a new deployment will be triggered every time you push to your git repository.

Now if you add the `.do` folder to your git repository values like `DATABASE_URL` and `SESSION_SECRET_KEY` will be exposed.
It is currently not possible to add these values to your configuration with `doctl` and if you add them manually through the UI they will get deleted every time you update your App Spec.
Luckily there is a workaround for this.

In `app.yaml` you have added `type: SECRET` to these environment variables. This means that DigitalOcean will encrypt them.
These values are bound to your application and can be safely stored in your git repository. Now you have to update your App Spec with these encrypted values.

Go to [App Platform](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps) and select your application. Next click on the Settings tab and view the Application Spec.

![App Spec settings](/img/do_app_spec.png)

Copy the App Spec with the encrypted values and replace the content of your local `app.yaml` file with the new content. Now you can safely store your configuration in git.
