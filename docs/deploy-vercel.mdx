You first need to change the defined datasource in `db/schema.prisma` from SQLite to Postgres

```diff
-datasource sqlite {
-  provider = "sqlite"
- url      = "file:./db.sqlite"
-
+datasource postgresql {
+  provider = "postgresql"
+  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
+}
```

Assuming you already have a [Vercel](https://vercel.com) account:

1. You need a production Postgres database. It's straightforward to set this up on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases-postgresql/?refcode=466ad3d3063d).
2. You also need a connection pool. This is also relatively straightforward to set up on Digital Ocean.
   1. [Read the Digital Ocean docs on setting up your connection pool](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/databases/postgresql/how-to/manage-connection-pools/#creating-a-connection-pool?refcode=466ad3d3063d)
   2. Ensure you set your "Pool Mode" to be "Session" instead of "Transaction" (because of a bug in Prisma)
3. You need your entire database connection string. If you need, [read the Prisma docs on this](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/database-connectors/postgresql#connection-details).
   1. Make sure you get the connection string to your connection pool, not directly to the DB.
   2. If using pgBouncer (default connection pool on Digital Ocean), you must add `?pgbouncer=true` to the end of your connection string for Prisma to work correctly.
4. Change your build script in package.json to be `NODE_ENV=production blitz db migrate && blitz build` so that the production DB will be migrated on each deploy
5. Add your DB url as a secret environment variable [using the UI](https://vercel.com/blog/environment-variables-ui) or by running `vercel env add DATABASE_URL`
6. Run `git push` if using the [Git Integration](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/git-integrations) or `vercel` if using Vercel CLI
