Blitz supports ES2020 [dynamic `import()`](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import) for JavaScript. With it you can import JavaScript modules (inc. React Components) dynamically and work with them. They also work with SSR.

You can think of dynamic imports as another way to split your code into manageable chunks.

## Basic usage

In the following example, the module `../components/hello` will be dynamically loaded by the page:

```jsx
import {dynamic} from "blitz"

const DynamicComponent = dynamic(() => import("../components/hello"))

function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <DynamicComponent />
      <p>HOME PAGE is here!</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Home
```

`DynamicComponent` will be the default component returned by `../components/hello`. It works like a regular React Component, and you can pass props to it as you normally would.

## With named exports

If the dynamic component is not the default export, you can use a named export too. Consider the module `../components/hello.js` which has a named export `Hello`:

```jsx
export function Hello() {
  return <p>Hello!</p>
}
```

To dynamically import the `Hello` component, you can return it from the [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) returned by [`import()`](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import#example), like so:

```jsx
import {dynamic} from "blitz"

const DynamicComponent = dynamic(() => import("../components/hello").then((mod) => mod.Hello))

function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <DynamicComponent />
      <p>HOME PAGE is here!</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Home
```

## With custom loading component

An optional `loading` component can be added to render a loading state while the dynamic component is being loaded. For example:

```jsx
import {dynamic} from "blitz"

const DynamicComponentWithCustomLoading = dynamic(() => import("../components/hello"), {
  loading: () => <p>...</p>,
})

function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <DynamicComponentWithCustomLoading />
      <p>HOME PAGE is here!</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Home
```

## With no SSR

You may not always want to include a module on server-side. For example, when the module includes a library that only works in the browser.

Take a look at the following example:

```jsx
import {dynamic} from "blitz"

const DynamicComponentWithNoSSR = dynamic(() => import("../components/hello3"), {
  ssr: false,
})

function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <DynamicComponentWithNoSSR />
      <p>HOME PAGE is here!</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Home
```
