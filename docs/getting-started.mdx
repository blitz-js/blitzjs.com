:::caution
Before getting started, you should know **this is alpha software**. Blitz is incomplete. There are rough spots and bugs. APIs may change. But you can build an app and deploy it to production. We're excited to see what you build!
:::

If you have any issues at all, please [open an issue](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/issues/new/choose) or join the [Blitz slack](https://slack.blitzjs.com) and talk to us in the **#help** channel. If you get stuck and frustrated, please don't blame yourself. This user guide, and Blitz in general, is not yet fine-tuned for those with less experience. But eventually, it will be because this is very important to us.

_If you‚Äôre looking for a slower, more guided start to Blitz, read the [Blitz Beginner Tutorial](./tutorial)._

### Set Up Your Computer

You need Node.js 12 or newer

### Install Blitz

Run `npm install -g blitz`

### Create a New App

1. `blitz new myAppName`
2. `cd myAppName`
3. `blitz start`
4. View your baby app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Set Up Your Database

By default, Blitz uses Prisma 2 which is a strongly typed database client. **You probably want to read [the Prisma 2 documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/understand-prisma/introduction).** _Note, Prisma 2 is not required for Blitz. You can use anything you want, such as Mongo, TypeORM, etc._

1. Open `db/schema.prisma` and add the following:

```prisma
model Project {
  id        Int      @default(autoincrement()) @id
  name      String
  tasks     Task[]
}

model Task {
  id          Int      @default(autoincrement()) @id
  name        String
  project     Project  @relation(fields: [projectId], references: [id])
  projectId   Int
}
```

2. Run `blitz db migrate`

### Scaffold out all the files for basic CRUD actions

_CRUD = create, read, update, delete_

1. Run `blitz generate all project` to generate fully working queries, mutations, and pages
2. Open [http://localhost:3000/projects](http://localhost:3000/projects) to see the default project list page
3. Explore the generated pages and view, create, update, and delete projects.
4. Create at least one project
5. Run `blitz generate all task --parent project` to generate fully working queries, mutations, and pages
6. Open [http://localhost:3000/projects/1/tasks](http://localhost:3000/projects/1/tasks) to see the default task list page
