:::caution
Before getting started, you should know **this is alpha software**. Blitz is incomplete. There are rough spots and bugs. APIs may change. But you can build an app and deploy it to production. We're excited to see what you build!
:::

If you have any issues at all, please [open an issue](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/issues/new/choose) or join the [Blitz slack](https://slack.blitzjs.com) and talk to us in the **#help** channel. If you get stuck and frustrated, please don't blame yourself. Our docs are not yet fine-tuned for those with less experience. But eventually, it will be because this is very important to us!
