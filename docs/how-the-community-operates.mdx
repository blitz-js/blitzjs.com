## Blitz is a Community Project 🤝

Blitz [was initially started by Brandon Bayer](./community-history), but from the very beginning it's always been a community project. 38 people contributed to the very first alpha version!

Blitz is not owned by a company, and it hasn't raised any venture capital.

Brandon works mostly full time on Blitz. He's averaged 30 hours per week since February 17, 2020 (so do the math if you want to see how much value you're getting for free 😉). And then he does consulting on the side to support himself.

All other contributors help in their free time. We now have [over 120 total contributors](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz#contributors-)!

**Because Blitz is a community project, the entire community gets to help shape Blitz and where it goes in the future.**

## Where to Ask Questions

First, search [the Blitz slack](https://slack.blitzjs.com) and [the Github repo](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz) so see if someone has already asked your question.

Next, [post your question in our Discussion Forum](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/discussions). This is much better than slack as it's easier for people to find and link to.

Then you're welcome to ask for help in slack and link to your Discussion thread, because Github Discussions don't have a Slack notification integration yet.

🙏 As you gain experience with Blitz, please help answer other peoples questions!

## How to Report a Bug

First, [search existing Github issues](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/issues?q=is%3Aissue) so see if someone has already reported your issue.

If not, then please [open a new issue](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/issues/new/choose)! Someone will usually reply to your new issue within a day or two.

## How to Propose Features/Changes

We love ideas and suggestions for how to make Blitz better! Just keep in mind we have a lot more feature ideas than contributor time to make them all happen. So it'd be great if you can make a PR too!

### Minor Changes

For minor changes like adding a new CLI flag or something, simply [open a new Github issue](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/issues/new/choose).

### Everything Else: RFCs

For any other features, even as small as adding a single new React hook, please post your request as an RFC (Request for Comments) as a [Github Discussion Thread](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/discussions/category_choices).

To post an RFC, do the following:

- Start the title with `[RFC]`
- Include the following sections
  - `### What do you want and why?`
  - `### How is this different from what you are currently doing?`
  - `### Possible implementation(s)`
- After posting, please also share it in Slack in `#-general`.

## Your Role

As a member of the Blitz community, we value your input, ideas, suggestions, and help!

Please feel very welcome to comment on any Github issue, pull request, RFC, etc! The community as a whole gets to shape where Blitz goes!

As you gain experience, we greatly appreciate your help including but not limited to, answering people's questions, reviewing PRs, improving documentation, submitting PRs, etc.

## Finances

Currently the total amount of sponsorships and donations is way below a normal living a wage. So all funds are currently going to Brandon. Once Brandon has a full time salary from Blitz, the funds will be used to pay others to work on Blitz too.

We also **really appreciate when companies who use Blitz pay their employees** to contribute to Blitz, either part-time or full-time!

## Core Team

The Blitz core team consists of people who are deeply invested in Blitz. Currently all core team members have been involved since day 1. (well probably day 10, but you get the idea :). The first 3 core members were chosen from the initial contributors. Going forward, diversity will be a key decision in selecting new core team members.

The core team has Github, Slack, and npm admin permissions.

## L1 Maintainers

Level 1 maintainers are critical for a healthy Blitz community and project. They take a lot of burden off the core team and level 2 maintainers so they can focus on higher level things with longer term impact. They primarily help manage the community and triage issues.
