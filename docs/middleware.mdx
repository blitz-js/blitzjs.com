HTTP Middleware is the escape hatch for [queries](./query-definition.mdx) and [mutations](./mutation-definition.mdx) to access HTTP primitives. Middleware can then pass data to queries and mutations using the middleware `res.blitzCtx` parameter.

Middleware should not be used for business logic, because http middleware is less composable and harder to test than queries and mutations. All business logic should live in queries & mutations.

For example, authentication middleware can set and read cookies and pass the session object to queries and mutations via the context object. Then queries and mutations will use the session object to perform authorization and whatever else they need to do.

## Middleware API

This API is essentially the same as connect/Express middleware but with an asynchronous `next()` function like Koa. The main difference when writing connect vs Blitz middleware is you must return a promise from Blitz middleware by doing `return next()` or `await next()`. See below for the `connectMiddleware()` adapter for existing connect middleware.

```js
import {Middleware} from "blitz"

const middleware: Middleware = async (req, res, next) => {
  res.blitzCtx.referer = req.headers.referer
  await next()
  console.log("Query/middleware result:", res.blitzResult)
}
```

### Arguments

- `req`: `MiddlewareRequest`
  - An instance of [http.IncomingMessage](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage), plus the following:
  - `req.cookies` - An object containing the cookies sent by the request. Defaults to `{}`
  - `req.query` - An object containing the [query string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string). Defaults to `{}`
  - `req.body` - An object containing the body parsed by `content-type`, or `null` if no body was sent
- `res`: `MiddlewareResponse`
  - An instance of [http.ServerResponse](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse), plus the following:
  - `res.blitzCtx` - An object that is passed as the second argument to queries and mutations. This how how middleware communicates with the rest of your app
  - `res.blitzResult` - The returned result from a query or mutation. To read from this, you must first `await next()`
  - `res.status(code)` - A function to set the status code. `code` must be a valid [HTTP status code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes)
  - `res.json(json)` - Sends a JSON response. `json` must be a valid JSON object
  - `res.send(body)` - Sends the HTTP response. `body` can be a `string`, an `object` or a `Buffer`
- `next()`: `MiddlewareNext`
  - **Required**: Callback for continuing the middleware chain. You must call this inside your middleware
  - **Required:** Returns a promise so you must either `await` it or return it like `return next()`. The promise resolves once all subsequent middleware has completed (including the Blitz query or mutation).

## Global Middleware

Global middleware runs for every Blitz query and mutation. It is defined in [`blitz.config.js`](./blitz-config.mdx) using the `middleware` key.

```js
// blitz.config.js
module.exports = {
  middleware: [
    (req, res, next) => {
      res.blitzCtx.referer = req.headers.referer
      return next()
    },
  ],
```

## Local Middleware

Local middleware only runs for a single query or mutation. It is defined by exporting a `middleware` array from a query or mutation.

```ts
// app/products/queries/getProduct.tsx
import {Middleware} from 'blitz'
import db, {FindOneProjectArgs} from "db"

type GetProjectInput = {
  where: FindOneProjectArgs["where"]
}

export const middleware: Middleware[] = [
  async (req, res, next) => {
    res.blitzCtx.referer = req.headers.referer
    await next()
    if (req.method !== "HEAD") {
      console.log("[Middleware] Loaded product:", res.blitzResult)
    }
  },
]

export default async function getProject({where}: GetProjectInput, ctx: Record<any, unknown> = {}) {
  console.log('Referer:', ctx.referer)
  return await db.project.findOne({where})
}

```

## Connect/Express Compatibility

Blitz provides a `connectMiddleware()` function take converts connect middleware to Blitz middleware.

```ts
// blitz.config.js
const {connectMiddleware} = require("blitz")
const cors = require("cors")

module.exports = {
  middleware: [connectMiddleware(cors)],
}
```

### Arguments

- `middleware` - Any connect/express middleware.
