Blitz mutations are plain, asynchronous Javascript functions that always run on the server.

**1. Mutations must be inside a `mutations` folder. All of the following are valid:**

- `app/mutations/createProject.ts`
- `app/projects/mutations/createProject.ts`
- `app/admin/projects/mutations/createProject.ts`

**2. Mutations must export a function as the default export**

You can write any normal Node.js code here, including database access and fetching from third-party APIs.

#### Example Mutation

```ts
// app/products/mutations/createProduct.tsx
import db, {ProjectCreateArgs} from "db"

type CreateProjectInput = {
  data: ProjectCreateArgs["data"]
}

export default async function createProject({data}: CreateProjectInput) {
  // Can do any processing, fetching from other APIs, etc

  const project = await db.project.create({data})

  return project
}
```

_We automatically alias the root of your project, so `import db from 'db'` is importing `<project_root>/db/index.ts`_

Next, [read these docs](./mutation-usage) to see how to use these mutations in your components.
