There are two basic ways to run Postgres locally:

1. Natively on your computer
2. Via Docker

Most people run Postgres natively without Docker as it's simpler, runs all the time in the background, and because Docker uses extra resources.

## Natively on your computer

### On Mac

There are two very popular options.

#### Install via Homebrew

1. Make sure you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed.
2. Run `brew install postgresql`
3. Run `brew services start postgresql`

And that's it!

#### Install via Postgres.app

1. Go to [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com/)
2. Download and install the app
3. Open the app and click "initalize" to create a new server

And then you are good to go!

### On Windows

The easiest way is to download and run the installer from [the Postgres website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/).

## Via Docker

1. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file inside the root of your project with the following content

```yaml
version: "3.7"

services:
  db:
    image: postgres:latest
    volumes:
      - data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    env_file: ./.env.local #Here we are using the already existing .env.local file
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"

volumes:
  data:
```

2. Inside your `.env.local` file add 3 new environment variables which are required by docker

```text
POSTGRES_USER=your_user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password
POSTGRES_DB=your_database_name
```

Given these values your `DATABASE_URL` should look like this `postgresql://your_user:your_password@localhost:5432/your_database_name`

3. Modify your `package.json` to run the database before the start of Blitz

```json
"scripts": {
    "start": "docker-compose up -d && blitz start",
}
```

4. Run `blitz db migrate` to get your new database to the latest version of your migrations
