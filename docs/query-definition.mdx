Blitz queries are plain, asynchronous Javascript functions that always run on the server.

**1. Queries must be inside a `query` folder. All of the following are valid:**

- `app/queries/getProject.ts`
- `app/projects/queries/getProject.ts`
- `app/admin/projects/queries/getProject.ts`

**2. Queries must export a function as the default export**

You can write any normal Node.js code here, including database access and fetching from third-party APIs.

#### Example Query

```ts
// app/products/queries/getProduct.tsx
import db, {FindOneProjectArgs} from "db"

type GetProjectInput = {
  where: FindOneProjectArgs["where"]
}

export default async function getProject({where}: GetProjectInput) {
  // Can do any processing, fetching from other APIs, etc

  const project = await db.project.findOne({where})

  return project
}
```

_We automatically alias the root of your project, so `import db from 'db'` is importing `<project_root>/db/index.ts`_

Next, [read these docs](./query-usage) to see how to use these queries in your components.
