:::caution
Before getting started, you should know **this is alpha software**. Blitz is incomplete. There are rough spots and bugs. APIs may change. But you can build an app and deploy it to production. We're excited to see what you build!
:::

Thanks for trying out Blitz! In this tutorial, we’ll walk you through the creation of a basic voting application.

We’ll assume that you have [Blitz installed](./getting-started) already. You can tell if Blitz is installed, and which version you have by running the following command in your terminal:

```sh
blitz -v
```

If Blitz is installed, you should see the version of your installation. If it isn’t, you’ll get an error saying something like “command not found: blitz”.

## Creating a project

If this is your first time using Blitz, you’ll have to begin with some initial setup. We provide a command which takes care of all this for you, generating the configuration and code you need to get started.

From the command line, `cd` into the directory where you’d like to store your code, and then run the following command:

```sh
blitz new mysite
```

This should create a `mysite` directory in your current directory.

Let’s look at what `blitz new` created:

```
mysite
├── app
│   ├── components
│   │   └── ErrorBoundary.tsx
│   ├── layouts
│   └── pages
│       ├── _app.tsx
│       ├── _document.tsx
│       └── index.tsx
├── db
│   ├── migrations
│   ├── index.ts
│   └── schema.prisma
├── integrations
├── node_modules
├── public
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   └── logo.png
├── utils
├── .babelrc.js
├── .env
├── .eslintrc.js
├── .gitignore
├── .npmrc
├── .prettierignore
├── README.md
├── blitz.config.js
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── yarn.lock
```

These files are:

- The `app/` directory is a container for most of your project. This is where you’ll put any pages or API routes.

- `db`/ is where your database configuration goes. If you’re writing models or checking migrations, this is where to go.

- `node_modules/` is where your “dependencies” are stored. This directory is updated by your package manager, so you don’t have to worry too much about it.

- `public/` is a directory where you will put any static assets. If you have images, files, or videos which you want to use in your app, this is where to put them.

- `utils/` is a good place to put any shared utility files which you might use across different sections of your app.

- `.babelrc.js`, `.env`, etc. ("dotfiles") are configuration files for various bits of JavaScript tooling.

- `blitz.config.js` is for advanced custom configuration of Blitz. It extends [`next.config.js`](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/introduction).

- `package.json` contains information about your dependencies and devDependencies. If you’re using a tool like `npm` or `yarn`, you won’t have to worry about this much.

- `tsconfig.json` is our recommended setup for TypeScript.

## The development server

Let’s check that your Blitz project works. Make sure you are in the `mysite` directory, if you haven’t already, and run the following command:

```sh
blitz start
```

You’ll see the following output on the command line:

```
✔ Prepped for launch
[ wait ]  starting the development server ...
[ info ]  waiting on http://localhost:3000 ...
[ info ]  bundled successfully, waiting for typecheck results...
[ wait ]  compiling ...
[ info ]  bundled successfully, waiting for typecheck results...
[ ready ] compiled successfully - ready on http://localhost:3000
```

Now that the server’s running, visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your Web browser. You’ll see a welcome page, with the Blitz logo. It worked!

## Write your first page

Now that your development environment—a “project”—is set up, you’re ready to start building out the app. First, we’ll create your first page.

Open the file `app/pages/index.tsx` and put the following code in it:

```tsx
export default () => (
  <div>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
  </div>
)
```

This is the simplest page possible in Blitz. To look at it, go back to your browser and go to http://localhost:3000. You should see your text appear! Try editing the `index.tsx` file, and make it your own! When you’re ready, move on to the next section.

## Database setup

By default, a Blitz app is created with a local SQLite database. If you’re new to databases, or you’re interested in trying Blitz, this is the easiest choice. Note that when starting your first real project, you may want to use a more scalable database like PostgreSQL, to avoid the pains of switching your database down the road. Your data source can be configured in the `db/schema.prisma` file, but for now we can simply move on to the next section.

## Generating content

Blitz provides a handy command called [`generate`](./cli-generate) for scaffolding out boilerplate code. We'll use `generate` to create two models: `Question` and `Choice`. A `Question` has the text of the question and a list of choices. A `Choice` has the text of the choice, a vote count, and an associated question. Both models automatically come with an id, a creation timestamp, and a last updated timestamp. In addition to the database layout, passing the `all` type to the `generate` command will also generate the corresponding queries, mutations, and pages for these models!

First, we'll generate everything pertaining to the `Question` model:

```sh
blitz generate all question text hasMany:choices
```

```
✔ Model for 'question' created successfully:

> model Question {
>   id        Int      @default(autoincrement()) @id
>   createdAt DateTime @default(now())
>   updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
>   text      String
>   choices   Choice[]
> }

Now run blitz db migrate to add this model to your database

CREATE    app/questions/pages/questions/index.tsx
CREATE    app/questions/pages/questions/new.tsx
CREATE    app/questions/pages/questions/[questionId]/edit.tsx
CREATE    app/questions/pages/questions/[questionId].tsx
CREATE    app/questions/components/QuestionForm.tsx
CREATE    app/questions/queries/getQuestions.ts
CREATE    app/questions/queries/getQuestion.ts
CREATE    app/questions/mutations/createQuestion.ts
CREATE    app/questions/mutations/deleteQuestion.ts
CREATE    app/questions/mutations/updateQuestion.ts
```

Then, the `Choice` model:

```sh
blitz generate all choice text votes:int:default[0] belongsTo:question
```

```
✔ Model for 'choice' created successfully:

> model Choice {
>   id         Int      @default(autoincrement()) @id
>   createdAt  DateTime @default(now())
>   updatedAt  DateTime @updatedAt
>   text       String
>   votes      Int      @default(0)
>   question   Question @relation(fields: [questionId], references: [id])
>   questionId Int
> }

Now run blitz db migrate to add this model to your database

CREATE    app/choices/pages/choices/index.tsx
CREATE    app/choices/pages/choices/new.tsx
CREATE    app/choices/pages/choices/[choiceId]/edit.tsx
CREATE    app/choices/pages/choices/[choiceId].tsx
CREATE    app/choices/components/ChoiceForm.tsx
CREATE    app/choices/queries/getChoices.ts
CREATE    app/choices/queries/getChoice.ts
CREATE    app/choices/mutations/createChoice.ts
CREATE    app/choices/mutations/deleteChoice.ts
CREATE    app/choices/mutations/updateChoice.ts
```

> Note: you can also edit the `db/schema.prisma` file directly if needed, either instead of using `generate` or afterwards if further modifications are needed.

Now, we need to migrate our database. This is a way of telling it that you have edited your schema in some way. Run the below command. When it asks you to enter a migration name, you can enter anything you want (perhaps "init db"):

```sh
blitz db migrate
```

## Playing with the API

Now, let’s hop into the interactive Blitz shell and play around with the free API Blitz gives you. To invoke the Blitz console, use this command:

```sh
blitz console
```

Once you’re in the console, explore the Database API:

```sh
# No questions are in the system yet.
⚡ > await db.question.findMany()
[]

# Create a new Question:
⚡ > let q = await db.question.create({data: {text: "What's new?"}})
undefined

# See the entire object:
⚡ > q
{
  id: 1,
  createdAt: 2020-06-15T15:06:14.959Z,
  updatedAt: 2020-06-15T15:06:14.959Z,
  text: "What's new?"
}

# Or, access individual values on the object:
⚡ > q.text
"What's new?"

⚡ > q.createdAt
2020-06-15T15:06:14.959Z

# Change values by using the update function:
⚡ > q = await db.question.update({where: {id: 1}, data: {text: "What's up?"}})
{
  id: 1,
  createdAt: 2020-06-15T15:06:14.959Z,
  updatedAt: 2020-06-15T15:13:17.394Z,
  text: "What's up?"
}

# db.question.findMany() now displays all the questions in the database:
⚡ > await db.question.findMany()
[
  {
    id: 1,
    createdAt: 2020-06-15T15:06:14.959Z,
    updatedAt: 2020-06-15T15:13:17.394Z,
    text: "What's up?"
  }
]
```

## Fixing generated pages

[//]: # "Remove this section once `generate` uses actual model attributes"

> Note: ultimately, this section will not be needed as the generated code will use actual model attributes. Coming soon!

Before running the app again, we need to customize some of these pages which have been generated. Open your text editor and look at `app/questions/pages/questions/index.tsx`. Notice that a `QuestionsList` component has been generated for you:

```jsx
export const QuestionsList = () => {
  const [questions] = useQuery(getQuestions, {orderBy: {id: "desc"}})

  return (
    <ul>
      {questions.map((question) => (
        <li key={question.id}>
          <Link href="/questions/[questionId]" as={`/questions/${question.id}`}>
            <a>{question.name}</a>
          </Link>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

This won’t work though! Remember that the `Question` model we created above doesn’t have any `name` field. To fix this, replace `question.name` with `question.text`:

```jsx
export const QuestionsList = () => {
  const [questions] = useQuery(getQuestions, {orderBy: {id: "desc"}})

  return (
    <ul>
      {questions.map((question) => (
        <li key={question.id}>
          <Link href="/questions/[questionId]" as={`/questions/${question.id}`}>
            <a>{question.text}</a>
          </Link>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

Next, let’s apply a similar fix to `app/questions/pages/questions/new.tsx`. In the form submission, replace

```jsx
const question = await createQuestion({data: {name: "MyName"}})
```

with

```jsx
const question = await createQuestion({data: {text: "Do you love Blitz?"}})
```

Finally, we need to fix the edit page. Open `app/questions/pages/questions/[questionId]/edit.tsx` and replace

```jsx
const updated = await updateQuestion({
  where: {id: question.id},
  data: {name: "MyNewName"},
})
```

with

```jsx
const updated = await updateQuestion({
  where: {id: question.id},
  data: {text: "Do you really love Blitz?"},
})
```

Great! Now make sure your app is running. If it isn’t, run `blitz start` in your terminal, and visit http://localhost:3000/questions. Play around with your new app a bit! Try creating questions, editing, and deleting them.

## Writing a minimal form

You’re doing great so far! The next thing we’ll do is give our form some real inputs. At the moment it’s giving every `Question` the same name! Have a look at `app/questions/components/QuestionForm.tsx` in your editor.

Delete the div that says: `<div>Put your form fields here. But for now, just click submit</div>`, and replace it with some inputs:

```jsx
<input placeholder="Name" />

<input placeholder="Choice 1" />
<input placeholder="Choice 1" />
<input placeholder="Choice 1" />
```

Finally, we’re going to make sure all that data is submitted. Open up `app/questions/pages/questions/new.tsx` in your editor and replace

```jsx
onSubmit={async () => {
  try {
    const question = await createQuestion({data: {name: "MyName"}});
    alert("Success!" + JSON.stringify(question));
    router.push("/questions/[questionId]", `/questions/${question.id}`);
  } catch (error) {
    alert("Error creating question " + JSON.stringify(error, null, 2));
  }
}}
```

with

```jsx
onSubmit={async (event) => {
  try {
    const question = await createQuestion({
      data: {
        text: event.target[0].value,
        choices: {
          create: [
            {text: event.target[1].value},
            {text: event.target[2].value},
            {text: event.target[3].value},
          ],
        },
      },
    });
    alert("Success!" + JSON.stringify(question));
    router.push("/questions/[questionId]", `/questions/${question.id}`);
  } catch (error) {
    alert("Error creating question " + JSON.stringify(error, null, 2));
  }
}}
```

In the end, your page should look something like this:

```jsx
import {Head, Link, useRouter, BlitzPage} from "blitz"
import createQuestion from "app/questions/mutations/createQuestion"
import QuestionForm from "app/questions/components/QuestionForm"

const NewQuestionPage: BlitzPage = () => {
  const router = useRouter()

  return (
    <div>
      <Head>
        <title>New Question</title>
        <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
      </Head>

      <main>
        <h1>Create New Question </h1>

        <QuestionForm
          initialValues={{}}
          onSubmit={async (event) => {
            try {
              const question = await createQuestion({
                data: {
                  text: event.target[0].value,
                  choices: {
                    create: [
                      {text: event.target[1].value},
                      {text: event.target[2].value},
                      {text: event.target[3].value},
                    ],
                  },
                },
              })
              alert("Success!" + JSON.stringify(question))
              router.push("/questions/[questionId]", `/questions/${question.id}`)
            } catch (error) {
              alert("Error creating question " + JSON.stringify(error, null, 2))
            }
          }}
        />

        <p>
          <Link href="/questions">
            <a>Questions</a>
          </Link>
        </p>
      </main>
    </div>
  )
}

export default NewQuestionPage
```

## Listing choices

Time for a breather. Go back to `http://localhost:3000/questions` in your browser and look at all the questions you‘ve created. How about we list these questions’ choices here too? First, we need to customize the question queries. In Prisma, you need to manually let the client know that you want to query for nested relations. Change your `getQuestion.ts` and `getQuestions.ts` files to look like this:

```js
// app/questions/queries/getQuestion.ts

export default async function getQuestion({where}: GetQuestionInput) {
  const question = await db.question.findOne({where, include: {choices: true}})

  return question
}
```

```js
// app/questions/queries/getQuestions.ts

export default async function getQuestions({
  where,
  orderBy,
  cursor,
  take,
  skip,
}: GetQuestionsInput) {
  const questions = await db.question.findMany({
    where,
    orderBy,
    cursor,
    take,
    skip,
    include: {choices: true},
  })

  return questions
}
```

Now hop back to our main questions page in your editor, and we can list the choices of each question. Add this code beneath the `Link` in our `QuestionsList`:

```jsx
<ul>
  {question.choices.map((choice) => (
    <li key={choice.id}>
      {choice.text} - {choice.votes} votes
    </li>
  ))}
</ul>
```

Magic! Let’s do one more thing–let people vote on these questions!

Open `app/questions/pages/questions/[questionId].tsx` in your editor. First, we’re going to improve this page somewhat.

1. Replace `<h1>Question {question.id}</h1>` with `<h1>{question.text}</h1>`.

2. Delete the `pre` element, and copy in our choices list which we wrote before:

```jsx
<ul>
  {question.choices.map((choice) => (
    <li key={choice.id}>
      {choice.text} - {choice.votes} votes
    </li>
  ))}
</ul>
```

If you go back to your browser, your page should now look something like this!

<img
  width="567"
  alt="Screenshot"
  src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24858006/80387990-3c3d8b80-88a1-11ea-956a-5be85f1e8f12.png"
/>

Now it’s time to add the vote button. In our `li`, add a `button` like so:

```jsx
<li key={choice.id}>
  {choice.text} - {choice.votes} votes
  <button>Vote</button>
</li>
```

Then, import the `updateChoice` mutation (generated at the beginning) and create a `handleVote` function in our page:

```jsx
import updateChoice from "app/choices/mutations/updateChoice"

...

const handleVote = async (id, votes) => {
  try {
    const updated = await updateChoice({
      where: {id},
      data: {votes: votes + 1},
    })
    alert("Success!" + JSON.stringify(updated))
  } catch (error) {
    alert("Error creating question " + JSON.stringify(error, null, 2))
  }
}

return (

...
```

Finally, we’ll tell our new `button` to call that function!

```jsx
<button onClick={() => handleVote(choice.id, choice.votes)}>Vote</button>
```

To be sure, this is what all that should look like:

```jsx
import React, {Suspense} from "react"
import {Head, Link, useRouter, useQuery, useParam, BlitzPage} from "blitz"
import getQuestion from "app/questions/queries/getQuestion"
import deleteQuestion from "app/questions/mutations/deleteQuestion"
import updateChoice from "app/choices/mutations/updateChoice"

export const Question = () => {
  const router = useRouter()
  const questionId = useParam("questionId", "number")
  const [question] = useQuery(getQuestion, {where: {id: questionId}})

  const handleVote = async (id, votes) => {
    try {
      const updated = await updateChoice({
        where: {id},
        data: {votes: votes + 1},
      })
      alert("Success!" + JSON.stringify(updated))
    } catch (error) {
      alert("Error creating question " + JSON.stringify(error, null, 2))
    }
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{question.text}</h1>
      <ul>
        {question.choices.map((choice) => (
          <li key={choice.id}>
            {choice.text} - {choice.votes} votes
            <button onClick={() => handleVote(choice.id, choice.votes)}>Vote</button>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>

      <Link href="/questions/[questionId]/edit" as={`/questions/${question.id}/edit`}>
        <a>Edit</a>
      </Link>

      <button
        type="button"
        onClick={async () => {
          if (window.confirm("This will be deleted")) {
            await deleteQuestion({where: {id: question.id}})
            router.push("/questions")
          }
        }}
      >
        Delete
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}

const ShowQuestionPage: BlitzPage = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Head>
        <title>Question</title>
        <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
      </Head>

      <main>
        <p>
          <Link href="/questions">
            <a>Questions</a>
          </Link>
        </p>

        <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
          <Question />
        </Suspense>
      </main>
    </div>
  )
}

export default ShowQuestionPage
```

## Conclusion
