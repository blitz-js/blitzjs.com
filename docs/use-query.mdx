### Example

React Concurrent Mode is enabled by default for Blitz apps. So the `<Suspense>` component is used for loading states and `<ErrorBoundary>` is used to display errors. If you need, you can read the [React Concurrent Mode Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-intro.html).

```tsx
import {Suspense} from "react"
import {useQuery, useRouter} from "blitz"
import getProject from "app/projects/queries/getProject"
import ErrorBoundary from "app/components/ErrorBoundary"

function Project() {
  const router = useRouter()
  const projectId = parseInt(router.query.projectId as string)
  const [project] = useQuery(getProject, {where: {id: projectId}})

  return <div>{project.name}</div>
}

function WrappedProject() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ErrorBoundary fallback={(error) => <div>Error: {JSON.stringify(error)}</div>}>
        <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
          <Project />
        </Suspense>
      </ErrorBoundary>
    </div>
  )
}

export default WrappedProject
```

## API

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
const [
  queryFunctionResults,
  {
    isFetching,
    failureCount,
    refetch,
    mutate,
  }
] = useQuery(blitzQueryFunction, queryInputArguments, {
  manual,
  retry,
  retryDelay,
  staleTime,
  cacheTime,
  refetchInterval,
  refetchIntervalInBackground,
  refetchOnWindowFocus,
  onSuccess,
  onError,
  onSettled,
  suspense,
  initialData,
  refetchOnMount,
})
```

### Arguments

- `blitzQueryFunction:` A [Blitz query function](./query-definition)
  - **Required**
- `queryInputArguments`
  - **Required**
  - The arguments that will be passed to `blitzQueryFunction`
- `options`
  - Optional

### Options

- `manual: Boolean`
  - Set this to `true` to disable automatic refetching when the query mounts or input arguments change.
  - To refetch the query, use the `refetch` method returned from the `useQuery` instance.
- `retry: Boolean | Int | Function(failureCount, error) => shouldRetry | Boolean`
  - If `false`, failed queries will not retry by default.
  - If `true`, failed queries will retry infinitely.
  - If set to an `Int`, e.g. `3`, failed queries will retry until the failed query count meets that number.
- `retryDelay: Function(retryAttempt: Int) => Int`
  - This function receives a `retryAttempt` integer and returns the delay to apply before the next attempt in milliseconds.
  - A function like `attempt => Math.min(attempt > 1 ? 2 ** attempt * 1000 : 1000, 30 * 1000)` applies exponential backoff.
  - A function like `attempt => attempt * 1000` applies linear backoff.
- `staleTime: Int | Infinity`
  - The time in milliseconds that cache data remains fresh. After a successful cache update, that cache data will become stale after this duration.
  - If set to `Infinity`, query will never go stale
- `cacheTime: Int | Infinity`
  - The time in milliseconds that unused/inactive cache data remains in memory. When a query's cache becomes unused or inactive, that cache data will be garbage collected after this duration.
  - If set to `Infinity`, will disable garbage collection
- `refetchInterval: false | Integer`
  - Optional
  - If set to a number, all queries will continuously refetch at this frequency in milliseconds
- `refetchIntervalInBackground: Boolean`
  - Optional
  - If set to `true`, queries that are set to continuously refetch with a `refetchInterval` will continue to refetch while their tab/window is in the background
- `refetchOnWindowFocus: Boolean`
  - Optional
  - Set this to `false` to disable automatic refetching on window focus (useful, when `refetchAllOnWindowFocus` is set to `true`).
  - Set this to `true` to enable automatic refetching on window focus (useful, when `refetchAllOnWindowFocus` is set to `false`.
- `onSuccess: Function(data) => data`
  - Optional
  - This function will fire any time the query successfully fetches new data.
- `onError: Function(err) => void`
  - Optional
  - This function will fire if the query encounters an error and will be passed the error.
- `onSettled: Function(data, error) => data`
  - Optional
  - This function will fire any time the query is either successfully fetched or errors and be passed either the data or error
- `initialData: any | Function() => any`
  - Optional
  - If set, this value will be used as the initial data for the query cache (as long as the query hasn't been created or cached yet)
  - If set to a function, the function will be called **once** during the shared/root query initialization, and be expected to synchronously return the initialData
- `refetchOnMount: Boolean`
  - Optional
  - Defaults to `true`
  - If set to `false`, will disable additional instances of a query to trigger background refetches
- `suspense: Boolean`
  - Optional
  - Enabled by default. Set this to `false` to disable suspense mode.

### Returns

`[queryFunctionResults, queryExtras]`

##### `queryFunctionResults: Any`

- Defaults to `undefined`.
- The last successfully resolved data for the query.

##### `queryExtras: Object`

- `isFetching: Boolean`
  - Defaults to `true` so long as `manual` is set to `false`
  - Will be `true` if the query is currently fetching, including background fetching.
- `failureCount: Integer`
  - The failure count for the query.
  - Incremented every time the query fails.
  - Reset to `0` when the query succeeds.
- `refetch()` - `Function({ force, throwOnError }) => void`
  - A function to manually refetch the query if it is stale.
  - To bypass the stale check, you can pass the `force: true` option and refetch it regardless of it's freshness
  - If the query errors, the error will only be logged. If you want an error to be thrown, pass the `throwOnError: true` option
- `mutate()` - `Function(newData, opts) => void`
  - A function to manually update the cache for a query.
  - `newData` can be an object of new data or a function that receives the old data and returns the new data
  - This is often used to instantly update the cache after submitting a form
  - After updating the cache, this will automatically call `refetch()` to ensure the data is correct. Disable refetch by passing an options object `{refetch: false}` as the second argument.
  - See the [Blitz mutation usage docs](./mutation-usage#mutate) for example usage of `mutate()`
