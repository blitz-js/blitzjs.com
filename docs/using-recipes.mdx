Blitz Recipes are predefined formulas for adding npm dependencies or other third-party code to your application. We've taken inspiration from [Gatsby Recipes](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/recipes/) (and are very appreciative of their help in the ideation phase for our own implementation) to improve on the existing flow of adding third-party dependencies to an application.

Rather than following a step-by-step guide from a documentation site that involves manually installing dependencies, updating configuration files, and copying code from example files - a process that can be very error-prone and tedious - we've built the Blitz installer to take a recipe and turn it into a wizard that guides you through the installation, almost exactly like installing software onto your desktop.

### How To Install a Recipe

The full list of Blitz Recipes can be found in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/tree/canary/recipes). The name of the recipe is the directory that contains the code. Take the name of the recipe you'd like to install, pass it to [`blitz install`](cli-build), and the installer will guide you through the process, providing you with an explanation for the changes along the way. For example, in the recipes directory today you'll see a recipe for `tailwind`, which installs [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). Executing `blitz install tailwind` is all it takes to get up and running, and you can let Blitz do the rest.

One of the best parts about recipes is that they're unversioned and pulled straight from GitHub. As soon as we make an update to a recipe and merge the changes on GitHub, it's available for you to execute. The same goes for [custom recipes](writing-recipes).
