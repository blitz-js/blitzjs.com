# What is Next.js?

[**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org/) is a popular React Framework with many built-in features, such as:

* An intuitive page-based routing system \(with support for dynamic routes\)
* Pre-rendering, both static generation \(SSG\) and server-rendering \(SSR\) are supported on a per-page basis
* Automatic code splitting for faster page loads
* Client-side routing with optimized prefetching
* Built-in CSS and Sass support, and support for any CSS-in-JS library
* Development environment which supports Hot Module Replacement
* API routes to build API endpoints with Serverless Functions
* Fully extendable

## FYI

Next.js is baked into blitz and almost all features of Next.js are supported. For more info on the differences see here: [Why use Blitz instead of Next.js](https://blitzjs.com/docs/why-blitz)
