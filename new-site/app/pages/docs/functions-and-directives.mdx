import { TipGood, TipBad } from '@/components/Tip'

## @tailwind

Use the `@tailwind` directive to insert Tailwind's `base`, `components`, `utilities` and `screens` styles into your CSS.

```css
/**
 * This injects Tailwind's base styles and any base styles registered by
 * plugins.
 */
@tailwind base;

/**
 * This injects Tailwind's component classes and any component classes
 * registered by plugins.
 */
@tailwind components;

/**
 * This injects Tailwind's utility classes and any utility classes registered
 * by plugins.
 */
@tailwind utilities;

/**
 * Use this directive to control where Tailwind injects the responsive
 * variations of each utility.
 *
 * If omitted, Tailwind will append these classes to the very end of
 * your stylesheet by default.
 */
@tailwind screens;
```

---

## @apply

Use `@apply` to inline any existing utility classes into your own custom CSS.

This is useful when you find a common utility pattern in your HTML that you'd like to extract to a new component.

```css
.btn {
  @apply font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded;
}
.btn-blue {
  @apply bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white;
}
```

Note that classes are applied based on their location in your original CSS, not based on the order you list them after the `@apply` directive. This is to ensure that the behavior you get when extracting a list of classes with `@apply` matches how those classes behave when listed directly in your HTML.

```css
/* Input */
.btn {
  @apply py-2 p-4;
}

/* Output */
.btn {
  padding: 1rem;
  padding-top: 0.5rem;
  padding-bottom: 0.5rem;
}
```

If you want fine-grained control over the order in which classes are applied, use multiple `@apply` statements:

```css
/* Input */
.btn {
  @apply py-2;
  @apply p-4;
}

/* Output */
.btn {
  padding-top: 0.5rem;
  padding-bottom: 0.5rem;
  padding: 1rem;
}
```

You can also mix `@apply` declarations with normal CSS declarations:

```css
/* Input */
.btn {
  transform: translateY(-1px);
  @apply bg-black;
}

/* Output */
.btn {
  background-color: #000;
  transform: translateY(-1px);
}
```

Any rules inlined with `@apply` will have `!important` **removed** by default to avoid specificity issues:

```css
/* Input */
.foo {
  color: blue !important;
}

.bar {
  @apply foo;
}

/* Output */
.foo {
  color: blue !important;
}

.bar {
  color: blue;
}
```

If you'd like to `@apply` an existing class and make it `!important`, simply add `!important` to the end of the declaration:


```css
/* Input */
.btn {
  @apply font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded !important;
}

/* Output */
.btn {
  font-weight: 700 !important;
  padding-top: .5rem !important;
  padding-bottom: .5rem !important;
  padding-right: 1rem !important;
  padding-left: 1rem !important;
  border-radius: .25rem !important;
}
```

Note that if you're using Sass/SCSS, you'll need to use Sass' interpolation feature to get this to work:

```css
.btn {
  @apply font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded #{!important};
}
```

---

## @layer

Use the `@layer` directive to tell Tailwind which "bucket" a set of custom styles belong to. Valid layers are a `base`, `components`, and `utilities`.

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@layer base {
  h1 {
    @apply text-2xl;
  }
  h2 {
    @apply text-xl;
  }
}

@layer components {
  .btn-blue {
    @apply bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded;
  }
}

@layer utilities {
  @variants hover, focus {
    .filter-none {
      filter: none;
    }
    .filter-grayscale {
      filter: grayscale(100%);
    }
  }
}
```

Tailwind will automatically move any CSS within a `@layer` directive to the same place as the corresponding `@tailwind` rule, so you don't have to worry as much about authoring your CSS in a specific order to avoid specificity issues.

Wrapping any custom CSS in a `@layer` directive also tells Tailwind to consider those styles for purging when purging that layer. Read our [documentation on optimizing for production](/docs/optimizing-for-production) for more details.

## @variants

You can generate `responsive`, `hover`, `focus`, `active`, and other [variants](/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states) of your own utilities by wrapping their definitions in the `@variants` directive.

```css
@variants focus, hover {
  .rotate-0 {
    transform: rotate(0deg);
  }
  .rotate-90 {
    transform: rotate(90deg);
  }
}
```

This will generate the following CSS:

```css
.rotate-0 {
  transform: rotate(0deg);
}
.rotate-90 {
  transform: rotate(90deg);
}

.focus\:rotate-0:focus {
  transform: rotate(0deg);
}
.focus\:rotate-90:focus {
  transform: rotate(90deg);
}

.hover\:rotate-0:hover {
  transform: rotate(0deg);
}
.hover\:rotate-90:hover {
  transform: rotate(90deg);
}
```

It's important to note that **variants are generated in the order you specify them**.

So if you want focus utilities to take priority over hover utilities for example, make sure focus comes *after* hover in the list:

```css
/* Input */
@variants hover, focus {
  .banana {
    color: yellow;
  }
}

/* Output */
.banana {
  color: yellow;
}
.hover\:banana:hover {
  color: yellow;
}
.focus\:banana:focus {
  color: yellow;
}
```

The `@variants` at-rule supports all of the values that are supported in the `variants` section of your config file, as well as any [custom variants](/docs/plugins#adding-variants) added through plugins.

## @responsive

You can generate responsive variants of your own classes by wrapping their definitions in the `@responsive` directive:

```css
@responsive {
  .bg-gradient-brand {
    background-image: linear-gradient(blue, green);
  }
}
```

This is a shortcut for writing out `@variants responsive { ... }` which works as well.

Using the default breakpoints, this would generate these classes:

```css
.bg-gradient-brand {
  background-image: linear-gradient(blue, green);
}

/* ... */

@media (min-width: 640px) {
  .sm\:bg-gradient-brand {
    background-image: linear-gradient(blue, green);
  }
  /* ... */
}

@media  (min-width: 768px) {
  .md\:bg-gradient-brand {
    background-image: linear-gradient(blue, green);
  }
  /* ... */
}

@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .lg\:bg-gradient-brand {
    background-image: linear-gradient(blue, green);
  }
  /* ... */
}

@media (min-width: 1280px) {
  .xl\:bg-gradient-brand {
    background-image: linear-gradient(blue, green);
  }
  /* ... */
}
```

The responsive variants will be added to Tailwind's existing media queries at the end of your stylesheet. This makes sure that classes with a responsive prefix always defeat non-responsive classes that are targeting the same CSS property.

---

## @screen

The `@screen` directive allows you to create media queries that reference your breakpoints by name instead of duplicating their values in your own CSS.

For example, say you have a `sm` breakpoint at `640px` and you need to write some custom CSS that references this breakpoint.

Instead of writing a raw media query that duplicates that value like this:

```css
@media (min-width: 640px) {
  /* ... */
}
```

...you can use the `@screen` directive and reference the breakpoint by name:

```css
@screen sm {
  /* ... */
}
```

---

## theme()

Use the `theme()` function to access your Tailwind config values using dot notation.

This can be a useful alternative to `@apply` when you want to reference a value from your theme configuration for only part of a declaration:

```css
.content-area {
  height: calc(100vh - theme('spacing.12'));
}
```

If you need to access a value that contains a dot (like the `2.5` value in the spacing scale), you can use square bracket notation:

```css
.content-area {
  height: calc(100vh - theme('spacing[2.5]'));
}
```

Since Tailwind uses a [nested object syntax](/docs/colors#nested-object-syntax) to define its default color palette, make sure to use dot notation to access the nested colors.

<TipBad>Don't use the dash syntax when accessing nested color values</TipBad>

```css
.btn-blue {
  background-color: theme('colors.blue-500');
}
```

<TipGood>Use dot notation to access nested color values</TipGood>

```css
.btn-blue {
  background-color: theme('colors.blue.500');
}
```
