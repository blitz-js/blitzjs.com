:::info
`getStaticProps` should only be used for pages that do not require authentication. The statically generated pages will be publicly available via your server and via a CDN if you have one. Therefore they cannot contain any personal or sensitive data.

Also, this is why there is no `req` and `res` objects for `getStaticProps`, because the pages are generated at build time, not at runtime. And at build time, there is no user http request to handle.
:::

If you export an `async` function called `getStaticProps` from a page, Blitz will pre-render this page at build time using the props returned by `getStaticProps`.

```jsx
export async function getStaticProps(context) {
  return {
    props: {}, // will be passed to the page component as props
  }
}
```

The `context` parameter is an object containing the following keys:

- `params` contains the route parameters for pages using dynamic routes. For example, if the page name is `[id].js` , then `params` will look like `{ id: ... }`. To learn more, take a look at the [Dynamic Routing documentation](/docs/routing#dynamic-route-segments). You should use this together with `getStaticPaths`, which we’ll explain later.
- `preview` is `true` if the page is in the preview mode and `false` otherwise. See the [Preview Mode documentation](./preview-mode).
- `previewData` contains the preview data set by `setPreviewData`. See the [Preview Mode documentation](./preview-mode).

> **Note**: You can import modules in top-level scope for use in `getStaticProps`.
> Imports used in `getStaticProps` will not be bundled for the client-side, as [explained below](#write-server-side-code-directly).

### Simple Example

**Example**: Your blog page needs to load it's data from your database or from a CMS (content management system).

```jsx
function Blog({posts}) {
  // Render posts...
}

// This function gets called during pre-rendering
export async function getStaticProps() {
  // 1. Use a Blitz query
  // 2. Directly access your database
  // 3. Or call an external API endpoint to get posts
  const posts = /* ... */

  // By returning { props: posts }, the Blog component
  // will receive `posts` as a prop at build time
  return {
    props: {
      posts,
    },
  }
}

export default Blog
```

### When should I use `getStaticProps`?

You should use `getStaticProps` if:

- The data for the page is not private and can be publicly available
- The data comes from headless CMS.
- The page must be pre-rendered (for SEO) and be very fast — `getStaticProps` generates HTML and JSON files, both of which can be cached by a CDN for performance.

### TypeScript: Use `GetStaticProps`

For TypeScript, you can use the `GetStaticProps` type from `blitz`:

```ts
import {GetStaticProps} from "blitz"

export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps = async (context) => {
  // ...
}
```

If you want to get inferred typings for your props, you can use `InferGetStaticPropsType<typeof getStaticProps>`, like this:

```tsx
import {InferGetStaticPropsType} from "blitz"

type Post = {
  author: string
  content: string
}

export const getStaticProps = async () => {
  const res = await fetch("https://.../posts")
  const posts: Post[] = await res.json()

  return {
    props: {
      posts,
    },
  }
}

function Blog({posts}: InferGetStaticPropsType<typeof getStaticProps>) {
  // will resolve posts to type Post[]
}

export default Blog
```

### Reading files: Use `process.cwd()`

Files can be read directly from the filesystem in `getStaticProps`.

In order to do so you have to get the full path to a file.

Since Blitz compiles your code into a separate directory you can't use `__dirname` as the path it will return will be different from the pages directory.

Instead you can use `process.cwd()` which gives you the directory where Blitz is being executed.

```jsx
import fs from "fs"
import path from "path"

// posts will be populated at build time by getStaticProps()
function Blog({posts}) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <li>
          <h3>{post.filename}</h3>
          <p>{post.content}</p>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}

// This function gets called at build time on server-side.
// It won't be called on client-side, so you can even do
// direct database queries. See the "Technical details" section.
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const postsDirectory = path.join(process.cwd(), "posts")
  const filenames = fs.readdirSync(postsDirectory)

  const posts = filenames.map((filename) => {
    const filePath = path.join(postsDirectory, filename)
    const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(filePath, "utf8")

    // Generally you would parse/transform the contents
    // For example you can transform markdown to HTML here

    return {
      filename,
      content: fileContents,
    }
  })
  // By returning { props: posts }, the Blog component
  // will receive `posts` as a prop at build time
  return {
    props: {
      posts,
    },
  }
}

export default Blog
```

### Technical details

#### Only runs at build time

Because `getStaticProps` runs at build time, it does **not** receive data that’s only available during request time, such as query parameters or HTTP headers as it generates static HTML.

#### Write server-side code directly

Note that `getStaticProps` runs only on the server-side. It will never be run on the client-side. It won’t even be included in the JS bundle for the browser. That means you can write code such as direct database queries without them being sent to browsers. You should not fetch an **API route** from `getStaticProps` — instead, you can write the server-side code directly in `getStaticProps`.

You can use [this tool](https://next-code-elimination.now.sh/) to verify what Blitz eliminates from the client-side bundle.

#### Statically Generates both HTML and JSON

When a page with `getStaticProps` is pre-rendered at build time, in addition to the page HTML file, Blitz generates a JSON file holding the result of running `getStaticProps`.

This JSON file will be used in client-side routing through `<Link>` or `next/router` ([documentation](/docs/api-reference/next/router.md)). When you navigate to a page that’s pre-rendered using `getStaticProps`, Blitz fetches this JSON file (pre-computed at build time) and uses it as the props for the page component. This means that client-side page transitions will **not** call `getStaticProps` as only the exported JSON is used.

#### Only allowed in a page

`getStaticProps` can only be exported from a **page**. You can’t export it from non-page files.

One of the reasons for this restriction is that React needs to have all the required data before the page is rendered.

Also, you must use `export async function getStaticProps() {}` — it will **not** work if you add `getStaticProps` as a property of the page component.

#### Runs on every request in development

In development (`blitz start`), `getStaticProps` will be called on every request.

#### Preview Mode

In some cases, you might want to temporarily bypass Static Generation and render the page at **request time** instead of build time. For example, you might be using a headless CMS and want to preview drafts before they're published.

This use case is supported by Blitz by the feature called **Preview Mode**. Learn more on the [Preview Mode documentation](./preview-mode).
