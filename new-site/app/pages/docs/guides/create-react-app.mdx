## Creating your project

Start by creating a new Create React App project if you don't have one set up already:

```shell
npx create-react-app my-project
```

## Setting up Tailwind CSS

Install Tailwind CSS, PostCSS, Autoprefixer and CRACO using `npm`:

```shell
npm install tailwindcss@npm:@tailwindcss/postcss7-compat postcss@^7 autoprefixer@^9 @craco/craco
```

Create React App currently only supports PostCSS 7, which is why we are installing [the compatibility build](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation#post-css-7-compatibility-build) for now.

Next, update your `scripts` in your `package.json` file to use `craco` instead of `react-scripts` for all scripts except `eject`:

```diff-json
  {
    // ...
    "scripts": {
-     "start": "react-scripts start",
-     "build": "react-scripts build",
-     "test": "react-scripts test",
+     "start": "craco start",
+     "build": "craco build",
+     "test": "craco test",
      "eject": "react-scripts eject"
    },
  }
```

Next generate your `tailwind.config.js` file:

```shell
npx tailwindcss init
```

Then create a `craco.config.js` at the root of our project and add the following PostCSS configuration:

```js
// craco.config.js
module.exports = {
  style: {
    postcss: {
      plugins: [require("tailwindcss/postcss7"), require("autoprefixer")],
    },
  },
};
```

Now, replace the content of `src/index.css` with all of the `@tailwind` directives needed to generate Tailwind's styles:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

That's it! Tailwind CSS is now installed in your project.
