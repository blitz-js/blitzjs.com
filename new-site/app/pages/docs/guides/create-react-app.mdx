<!-- 
#####
Launch day test: getting errors with the `require('tailwindcss/postcss7')` in craco config.
Changing that to `require('tailwindcss') fixes it.

## Creating your project

Start by creating a new Create React App project if you don't have one set up already:

```shell
npx create-react-app my-project
```

## Setting up Tailwind CSS

Install Tailwind, Autoprefixer and CRACO using `npm` or `yarn`:

```shell
npm install tailwindcss@compat autoprefixer@9 @craco/craco
```

> Create React App currently only supports PostCSS 7, so you need to install the compatibility version of Tailwind CSS and Autoprefixer v9 until they update to PostCSS 8.

Next, update your `scripts` in your `package.json` file to use `craco` instead of `react-scripts` for all scripts except `eject`:

```diff-json
  {
    // ...
    "scripts": {
-     "start": "react-scripts start",
-     "build": "react-scripts build",
-     "test": "react-scripts test",
+     "start": "craco start",
+     "build": "craco build",
+     "test": "craco test",
      "eject": "react-scripts eject"
    },
  }
```

Next, let's generate default `tailwind.config.js`:

```shell
npx tailwindcss init
```

Then, let's create a `craco.config.js` at the root of our project, with the following settings:

```js
// craco.config.js
module.exports = {
  style: {
    postcss: {
      plugins: [require("tailwindcss/postcss7"), require("autoprefixer")],
    },
  },
};
```

Now, let's replace the content of `src/index.css` with the following:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

That's it! Tailwind CSS is now available throughout our entire application ðŸŽ‰
