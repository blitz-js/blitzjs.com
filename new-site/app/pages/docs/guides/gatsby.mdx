Launch day test: this works with the normal version of Tailwind - no need for @compat! ðŸŽ‰
I have updgraded the guide to reflect so.

# Using Tailwind CSS with Gatsby

## Creating your project

Start by creating a new Gatsby project if you don't have one set up already. The most common approach is to use the [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/quick-start/#install-the-gatsby-cli):

```shell
gatsby new my-project
```

## Setting up Tailwind CSS

Install Tailwind, Autoprefixer, PostCSS and the `gatsby-plugin-postcss` Gatsby plugin using `npm` or `yarn`:

```shell
npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer gatsby-plugin-postcss
```

Next, let's generate default `tailwind.config.js` **and** `postcss.config.js` files:

```shell
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Let's include our Gatsby plugin in our `gatsby-config.js`:

```js
plugins: [`gatsby-plugin-postcss`],
```

Let's create a new CSS file in our `src` directory called `tailwind.css`. This file will contain three `@tailwind` declaratives:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Finally, let's import this file in our layout. In this example, this corresponds to the `src/components/layout.js` file.

```js
import "../tailwind.css";
```

That's it! Tailwind CSS is now available throughout our entire Gatsby project ðŸŽ‰
