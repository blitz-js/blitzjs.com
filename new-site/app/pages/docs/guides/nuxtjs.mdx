# Using Tailwind CSS with Nuxt.js

## Creating your project

Start by creating a new Nuxt.js project if you don't have one set up already. The most common approach is to use [`create-nuxt-app`](https://nuxtjs.org/guides/get-started/installation#using-create-nuxt-app):

```shell
npx create-nuxt-app my-project
```

## Setting up Tailwind CSS

If you've used `create-nuxt-app` and selected Tailwind CSS at the "UI Framework" step, you're already done - Tailwind will work out of the box! üëç

For other cases, you'll need to install the `@nuxtjs/tailwindcss` module. Let's add that dependency to our project using `npm` or `yarn`:

```shell
npm install -D @nuxtjs/tailwindcss
```

Next, add it to your `buildModules` section in your `nuxt.config.js` file:

```js
// nuxt.config.js
export default {
  buildModules: ['@nuxtjs/tailwindcss']
}
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: if you are using version `2.9.0` of Nuxt or earlier, use the `modules` property instead of `buildModules`.

That's it! Tailwind CSS is now available in your entire Nuxt project üéâ

## Customizing the Taliwind config and writing custom CSS

If you want to customise the Tailwind config, simply create a `tailwind.config.js` in your project root.

The `@nuxtjs/tailwindcss` module will also look for a CSS file in `./assets/css/tailwind.css`, which is where you can write your custom CSS and use things like `@apply`, `@responsive` or `@screen` directives.

If no file is found at that location, the default three `@tailwind` layer directives will be used:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

You can find more information on more advanced features of the `@nuxtjs/tailwindcss` module here: https://tailwindcss.nuxtjs.org/
