## Creating your project

Start by creating a new Vue 3 project if you don't have one set up already. A possible approach here is to use [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite#getting-started):

```shell
npm init vite-app my-project
```

Next, move into your new `my-project` directory and install the front-end dependencies using `npm` or `yarn`:

```shell
cd my-project && yarn
```

## Setting up Tailwind CSS

Install Tailwind and Autoprefixer as `devDependencies` using `npm` or `yarn`:

```shell
npm install -D tailwindcss autoprefixer@^9
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Note that at the time of writing this guide, we need to stick to version 9 of Autoprefixer. This will go away when NextJS internally upgrades to PostCSS 8, at what point we'll update this guide! üòÖ

Next, let's generate default config files for Tailwind CSS and PostCSS:

```shell
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Next, let's create a new CSS file. In this example, we called it `tailwind.css` and put it in the `src` directory. We'll add the 3 `@tailwind` directives in that file:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Let's now import this new CSS file in our `main.js` entry point:

```diff-js
  import { createApp } from "vue";
  import App from "./App.vue";
+ import "./tailwind.css";

  createApp(App).mount("#app");
```

That's it! Tailwind CSS is now available throughout your Vue 3 application üéâ
