## Installing Tailwind as a PostCSS plugin

For most real-world projects, we recommend installing Tailwind as a PostCSS plugin. Most modern frameworks use PostCSS under the hood already, and there's a good chance you've used or are currently using other PostCSS plugins like [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer).

If you've never heard of PostCSS or are wondering how it's different from tools like Sass, read our guide on [using PostCSS as your preprocessor](/docs/using-with-preprocessors#using-post-css-as-your-preprocessor) for an introduction.

If this is a bit over your head and you'd like to try Tailwind without configuring PostCSS, read our instructions on [using Tailwind without PostCSS](#using-tailwind-without-post-css) instead.

### Install Tailwind via npm

For most projects (and to take advantage of Tailwind's customization features), you'll want to install Tailwind and its peer-dependencies via npm.

```shell
npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```

Since Tailwind [does not automatically add vendor prefixes](/docs/browser-support#vendor-prefixes) to the CSS it generates, we recommend installing [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) to handle this for you.

If you're integrating Tailwind with a tool that relies on an older version of PostCSS, you may see an error like this:

```shell
Error: PostCSS plugin tailwindcss requires PostCSS 8.
```

In this case, you should [install the PostCSS 7 compatibility build](#post-css-7-compatibility-build) instead.

### Add Tailwind as a PostCSS plugin

Add `tailwindcss` and `autoprefixer` to your PostCSS configuration. Most of the time this is a `postcss.config.js` file at the root of your project, but it could also be a `.postcssrc` file, or `postcss` key in your `package.json` file.

```js
// postcss.config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
```

If you aren't sure where PostCSS plugins are configured for the tools you're using, you'll want to refer to the documentation for those tools to learn where this should go. A search for "configure postcss {my tool}" will get you the answer pretty fast too.

If you're using any other PostCSS plugins, you should read our documentation on [using PostCSS as your preprocessor](/docs/using-with-preprocessors) for more details about the best way to order them with Tailwind.

### Create your configuration file

If you'd like to customize your Tailwind installation, generate a config file for your project using the Tailwind CLI utility included when you install the `tailwindcss` npm package:

```shell
npx tailwindcss init
```

This will create a minimal `tailwind.config.js` file at the root of your project:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  purge: [],
  darkMode: false, // or 'media' or 'class'
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {},
  plugins: [],
}
```

Learn more about configuring Tailwind in the [configuration documentation](/docs/configuration).

### Include Tailwind in your CSS

Create a CSS file if you don't already have one, and use the `@tailwind` directive to inject Tailwind's `base`, `components`, and `utilities` styles:

```css
/* ./your-css-folder/styles.css */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Tailwind will swap these directives out at build-time with all of the styles it generates based on your configured design system.

If you're using `postcss-import` (or a tool that uses it under the hood, such as [Webpacker](https://github.com/rails/webpacker) for Rails), use our imports instead of the `@tailwind` directive to avoid issues when importing any of your own additional files:

```css
@import "tailwindcss/base";
@import "tailwindcss/components";
@import "tailwindcss/utilities";
```

If you're working in a JavaScript framework like React or Vue that supports directly importing CSS files into your JS, you can also skip creating a CSS file altogether and import `tailwindcss/tailwind.css` instead which has all of these directives already in place:

```js
// app.js
import "tailwindcss/tailwind.css"
```
