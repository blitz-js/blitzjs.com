## <Heading hidden>Overview</Heading>

Every utility class in Tailwind can be applied conditionally at different breakpoints, which makes it a piece of cake to build complex responsive interfaces without ever leaving your HTML.

There are five breakpoints by default, inspired by common device resolutions:

| Breakpoint prefix | Minimum width | CSS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sm` | 640px | `@media (min-width: 640px) { ... }` |
| `md` | 768px | `@media (min-width: 768px) { ... }` |
| `lg` | 1024px | `@media (min-width: 1024px) { ... }` |
| `xl` | 1280px | `@media (min-width: 1280px) { ... }` |
| `2xl` | 1536px | `@media (min-width: 1536px) { ... }` |

To add a utility but only have it take effect at a certain breakpoint, all you need to do is prefix the utility with the breakpoint name, followed by the `:` character:

```html
<!-- Width of 16 by default, 32 on medium screens, and 48 on large screens -->
<img class="w-16 **md:w-32** **lg:w-48**" src="...">
```

This works for **every utility class in the framework**, which means you can change literally anything at a given breakpoint — even things like letter spacing or cursor styles.

Here's a simple example of a marketing page component that uses a stacked layout on small screens, and a side-by-side layout on larger screens *(resize your browser to see it in action)*:

```html indigo
<template preview class="px-6 py-8">
  <div class="max-w-md mx-auto bg-white rounded-xl shadow-md overflow-hidden md:max-w-2xl">
    <div class="md:flex">
      <div class="md:flex-shrink-0">
        <img class="h-48 w-full object-cover md:w-48" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1515711660811-48832a4c6f69?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=448&q=80" width="448" height="299" alt="Man looking at item at a store">
      </div>
      <div class="p-8">
        <div class="uppercase tracking-wide text-sm text-indigo-500 font-semibold">Case study</div>
        <a href="#" class="block mt-1 text-lg leading-tight font-medium text-black hover:underline">Finding customers for your new business</a>
        <p class="mt-2 text-gray-500">Getting a new business off the ground is a lot of hard work. Here are five ideas you can use to find your first customers.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

<div class="max-w-md mx-auto bg-white rounded-xl shadow-md overflow-hidden **md:max-w-2xl**">
  <div class="**md:flex**">
    <div class="**md:flex-shrink-0**">
      <img class="h-48 w-full object-cover **md:w-48**" src="/img/store.jpg" alt="Man looking at item at a store">
    </div>
    <div class="p-8">
      <div class="uppercase tracking-wide text-sm text-indigo-500 font-semibold">Case study</div>
      <a href="#" class="block mt-1 text-lg leading-tight font-medium text-black hover:underline">Finding customers for your new business</a>
      <p class="mt-2 text-gray-500">Getting a new business off the ground is a lot of hard work. Here are five ideas you can use to find your first customers.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

Here's how the example above works:

- By default, the outer `div` is `display: block`, but by adding the `md:flex` utility, it becomes `display: flex` on medium screens and larger.
- When the parent is a flex container, we want to make sure the image never shrinks, so we've added `md:flex-shrink-0` to prevent shrinking on medium screens and larger. Technically we could have just used `flex-shrink-0` since it would do nothing on smaller screens, but since it only matters on `md` screens, it's a good idea to make that clear in the class name.
- On small screens the image is automatically full width by default. On medium screens and up, we've constrained that width to a fixed size using `md:w-56`.
- On small screens, the content section uses `mt-4` to add some margin between the content and the image. This margin isn't necessary in the horizontal layout, so we've used `md:mt-0` to undo that margin, and used `md:ml-6` to add some left margin instead.

We've only used one breakpoint in this example, but you could easily customize this component at other sizes using the `sm`, `lg`, or `xl` responsive prefixes as well.

## Mobile First

By default, Tailwind uses a mobile first breakpoint system, similar to what you might be used to in other frameworks like Bootstrap.

What this means is that unprefixed utilities (like `uppercase`) take effect on all screen sizes, while prefixed utilities (like `md:uppercase`) only take effect at the specified breakpoint *and above*.

### Targeting mobile screens

Where this approach surprises people most often is that to style something for mobile, you need to use the unprefixed version of a utility, not the `sm:` prefixed version. Don't think of `sm:` as meaning "on small screens", think of it as "at the small *breakpoint*".

<TipBad>Don't use <code className="text-sm font-bold text-gray-800">sm:</code> to target mobile devices</TipBad>

```html
<!-- This will only center text on screens 640px and wider, not on small screens -->
<div class="sm:text-center"></div>
```

<TipGood>Use unprefixed utilities to target mobile, and override them at larger breakpoints</TipGood>

```html
<!-- This will center text on mobile, and left align it on screens 640px and wider -->
<div class="text-center sm:text-left"></div>
```

For this reason, it's often a good idea to implement the mobile layout for a design first, then layer on any changes that make sense for `sm` screens, followed by `md` screens, etc.

### Targeting a single breakpoint

Tailwind's breakpoints only include a `min-width` and don't include a `max-width`, which means any utilities you add at a smaller breakpoint will also be applied at larger breakpoints.

If you'd like to apply a utility at one breakpoint only, the solution is to *undo* that utility at larger sizes by adding another utility that counteracts it.

Here is an example where the background color is red at the `md` breakpoint, but teal at every other breakpoint:

```html
<div class="bg-teal-500 md:bg-red-500 lg:bg-teal-500">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

Notice that **we did not** have to specify a background color for the `sm` breakpoint or the `xl` breakpoint — you only need to specify when a utility should *start* taking effect, not when it should stop.

## Customizing breakpoints

You can completely customize your breakpoints in your `tailwind.config.js` file:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    screens: {
      'tablet': '640px',
      // => @media (min-width: 640px) { ... }

      'laptop': '1024px',
      // => @media (min-width: 1024px) { ... }

      'desktop': '1280px',
      // => @media (min-width: 1280px) { ... }
    },
  }
}
```
